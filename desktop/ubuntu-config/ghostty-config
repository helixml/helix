# Ghostty Terminal Configuration for Helix Desktop
# Modern GPU-accelerated terminal with native blur support

# CRITICAL: Disable single-instance mode
# Single-instance mode uses D-Bus activation which drops -e command arguments
# This breaks launch_terminal() in start-zed-helix.sh which needs to run scripts
# Memory savings aren't worth losing the ability to launch terminals with commands
