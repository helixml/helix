# Helix Diffusers

This is a simple FastAPI server that uses the Diffusers library to generate images from text prompts.

It is baked into the Helix runner, and weights are baked into the base-runner image.

## Development

You must have `uv` installed.

To run the server locally, use `uv run main.py`.

To run the tests, use `uv run pytest`.
