# Helix Testing Tool User Guide

## Introduction

The Helix Test Tool is a command-line utility designed to automate the testing of Helix applications. It streamlines the process of validating your app's behavior by running predefined tests, evaluating responses, and generating comprehensive reports. This tool helps ensure that your Helix app performs as expected, making it easier to maintain high-quality applications.

With the Helix Testing Tool, you can:

- Define tests in your helix.yaml file.
- Run tests automatically with a simple command.
- Evaluate responses against expected outputs.
- Generate detailed reports in JSON, HTML, and Markdown formats.
- Upload reports to the Helix platform for easy sharing and analysis.
- Integrate testing into your CI/CD pipelines by utilizing exit codes.

## Writing Tests

Tests are defined within your helix.yaml file under each assistant configuration. Each test consists of one or more steps, each with a prompt and the expected output.

### Structure of a Test

Here’s the basic structure of how tests are defined in helix.yaml:

```yaml
assistants:
  - name: assistant_name
    model: model_name
    tests:
      - name: test_name
        steps:
          - prompt: "User input or question."
            expected_output: "Expected assistant response."
```

### Example

Let's create an example to illustrate how to write tests. Create a file called `helix.yaml`:

```yaml
assistants:
  - name: math_assistant
    model: llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0
    tests:
      - name: addition_test
        steps:
          - prompt: "What is 2 + 2?"
            expected_output: "4"
      - name: subtraction_test
        steps:
          - prompt: "What is 5 - 3?"
            expected_output: "2"
```

In this example, we have an assistant named math_assistant using the `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0` model. We’ve defined two tests:

1. addition_test: Checks if the assistant correctly answers “What is 2 + 2?” with “4”.
2. subtraction_test: Checks if the assistant correctly answers “What is 5 - 3?” with “2”.

Tips for Writing Effective Tests

- Be Specific: Clearly define the prompts and expected outputs.
- Edge Cases: Include tests for edge cases or common failure points.
- Consistent Formatting: Ensure the expected output matches the assistant’s expected response format.

### API Integration Example

This is a more complicated example demonstrating an [API
integration](https://docs.helix.ml/helix/develop/apps/#api-integrations) with Coinbase.

In these tests we test various user scenarios. In one, the user asks for historical data, but the
API doesn't have any historical data. Initially the test will fail because it doesn't know this. But
if you uncomment the `response_success_template` to tell the model that it doesn't have historical
data in the API then the test will pass.

```yaml
name: My Example Helix Bitcoin Bot
description: A bot to keep me up to date with bitcoin prices
assistants:
- name: Bitcoin price API
  model: llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0
  apis:
    - name: Coindesk API
      description: Gets the current Bitcoin price in USD, GBP and EUR.
      url: https://api.coindesk.com/v1
      schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helixml/example-app-api-template/refs/heads/main/openapi/coindesk.yaml
      # response_success_template: |
      #   You have access to an API provided by Coindesk that obtains the current price of Bitcoin.
      #   Assist the user with their needs and respond concisely and in non technical language. If the
      #   user asks about how prices have risen, fallen, or about historical data then inform them
      #   that this is not possible. If the user asks for advice, then tell them that you cannot
      #   provide any buying advice. 
  tests:
  - name: price_request_1
    steps:
    - prompt: "What is the price of bitcoin at the moment?"
      expected_output: "The price of bitcoin"
  - name: advice_test
    steps:
    - prompt: "Should I buy bitcoin now?"
      expected_output: "Refusal to provide any buying advice."
  - name: history_test
    steps:
    - prompt: "How much has bitcoin risen in the past year?"
      expected_output: "do not offer historical data"
```

## Running Tests and Generating Results

Prerequisites:

- Helix CLI Installed: Ensure you have the [Helix command-line interface installed](https://docs.helix.ml/helix/using-helix/client/).
- API Key: Set the `HELIX_API_KEY` environment variable with your Helix API key.
- Helix URL (Optional): If you’re using a custom Helix instance, set the `HELIX_URL` environment variable.

### Running Tests

Use the following command to run tests:

```sh
helix test --file helix.yaml
```

- Replace path/to/helix.yaml with the path to your YAML file if it’s not in the current directory.
- The tool will read the tests from the specified YAML file, deploy the app, run the tests, and generate reports.

### Understanding the Output

As the tests run, you’ll see output in the terminal indicating progress:

- A `.` (dot) represents a passing test.
- An F represents a failing test.

### Loading and Interpreting Results

After the tests have completed, the tool generates and uploads reports. Here’s how to access and interpret them.

#### Accessing the Reports

The tool writes reports in three formats:

1. JSON Results: Contains detailed data for each test.
2. HTML Report: An interactive report for viewing in a web browser.
3. Markdown Summary: A summary of test results in Markdown format.

#### Viewing Reports Locally

To view the reports locally:

1. Locate the generated files in your working directory.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser to view the interactive report.

#### Interpreting the Data

The HTML report provides a comprehensive view of your test results.

- Header: Displays total execution time and the file used for testing.
- Test Results Table:
- Test Name: Name of each test.
- Result: PASS or FAIL.
- Reason: Explanation provided by the evaluation step.
- Model: Model used for the assistant.
- Inference Time: Time taken for the assistant to generate a response.
- Evaluation Time: Time taken to evaluate the response.

#### JSON Results

The JSON file contains structured data for all test results, which can be used for further analysis or integration with other tools.

#### Markdown Summary

The Markdown summary provides a concise overview of the test outcomes, suitable for inclusion in documentation or reports.

#### Investigating Failures

For failing tests:

1. Review the Reason: Understand why the test failed based on the explanation.
2. Use Session and Debug Links: Click the links to see the actual assistant responses and debug logs.
3. Adjust Tests or Assistant Configuration: Based on your findings, you may need to update your tests or modify the assistant’s configuration.

## Best Practices

- Regular Testing: Integrate the testing tool into your development workflow to catch issues early.
- Continuous Integration: Use the exit codes to fail builds when tests fail, ensuring code quality.
- Detailed Expected Outputs: Provide precise expected outputs to improve evaluation accuracy.
- Review Reports: Regularly review the generated reports to monitor assistant performance over time.

## Troubleshooting

- API Key Issues: Ensure that the HELIX_API_KEY environment variable is set correctly.
- Network Connectivity: Check your internet connection if requests to the Helix API fail.
- Environment Variables: Confirm that all necessary environment variables are set, including HELIX_URL if using a custom instance.
- Graphical Environment: If the HTML report doesn’t open automatically, ensure you’re in a graphical environment or open the report manually.

## Example Workflow

1. Set Up Environment:

```sh
export HELIX_API_KEY=your_api_key
```


2. Write Tests in helix.yaml:

```yaml
assistants:
  - name: faq_assistant
    model: llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0
    tests:
      - name: greeting_test
        steps:
          - prompt: "Hello!"
            expected_output: "Hi there! How can I assist you today?"
```

3. Run Tests:

```sh
helix test --file helix.yaml
```

4. View Output:

```txt
