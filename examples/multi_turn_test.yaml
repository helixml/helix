          - prompt: I need to calculate the area of a rectangle.
            expected_output: |
              I can help you calculate the area of a rectangle. 
              The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
              Area = Length Ã— Width
              
              Please provide the length and width of your rectangle.
          
          - prompt: The length is 10 meters and the width is 5 meters.
            expected_output: |
              Let's calculate the area of your rectangle:
              
              Area = Length Ã— Width
              Area = 10 meters Ã— 5 meters
              Area = 50 square meters
              
              The area of your rectangle is 50 square meters.
          
          - prompt: What would the perimeter be?
            expected_output: |
              Let's calculate the perimeter of your rectangle:
              
              The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
              Perimeter = 2 Ã— (Length + Width)
              
              Using your dimensions:
              Perimeter = 2 Ã— (10 meters + 5 meters)
              Perimeter = 2 Ã— 15 meters
              Perimeter = 30 meters
              
              The perimeter of your rectangle is 30 meters.

              I'm organizing a party for 20 people. If each person eats 3 slices of pizza, 
              and each pizza has 8 slices, how many pizzas should I order?
            expected_output: |
              Let's solve this step-by-step:
              
              1. Calculate the total number of slices needed:
                 20 people Ã— 3 slices per person = 60 slices
                 
              2. Determine how many pizzas that equals:
                 60 slices Ã· 8 slices per pizza = 7.5 pizzas
                 
              Since you can't order a partial pizza, you should order 8 pizzas to ensure everyone gets their 3 slices.
          
          - prompt: |
              What if we also need 2 cans of soda per person? How many packs of soda should I buy if they come in 6-packs?
            expected_output: |
              Let's calculate how many 6-packs of soda you'll need:
              
              1. Total cans needed:
                 20 people Ã— 2 cans per person = 40 cans
                 
              2. Number of 6-packs needed:
                 40 cans Ã· 6 cans per pack = 6.67 packs
                 
              Since you can't buy a partial pack, you should buy 7 six-packs of soda to have enough for everyone.
