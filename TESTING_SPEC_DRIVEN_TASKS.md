# Testing Spec-Driven Tasks with Zed Runners

This guide walks you through testing the complete spec-driven task system using the **actual UI buttons and interactions** - no API calls needed!

## Architecture Overview

**Zed Runner**: Always-on task execution agent (replaces gptscript runner)
- Handles spec-driven tasks and code implementation
- No profile needed - starts with basic `./stack start`
- RDP access for watching agents work

**GPU Runner**: Optional LLM inference runner (unchanged)
- Handles AI model inference (spec generation)
- Started with `WITH_RUNNER=1` for GPU acceleration
- Profile-based, only needed for local LLM inference

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.21+
- OpenAI API key (for spec generation)
- RDP client (for watching Zed agents work)
- Zed source code at `../zed/` (relative to Helix directory)

## Quick Start

### 1. Start Services (Auto-builds Zed if needed)

```bash
# Start all services including Zed task runner
./stack start

# OR with GPU LLM inference (if you have GPU)
WITH_RUNNER=1 ./stack start
```

The stack script will:
- Check if `../zed/` exists (if not, tell you to get it)
- Check if Zed binary exists, build if needed
- Start all services including the Zed runner

### 2. Verify Zed Runner is Active

```bash
# Check services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml ps

# Should see 'helix-zed-runner' container

# Test Zed runner is responding
curl http://localhost:3030/health
```

### 3. Connect via RDP to Watch Agents

```bash
# RDP connection:
# Host: localhost:5900
# User: zed
# Password: zed123

# Use any RDP client:
# - Windows: mstsc
# - Mac: Microsoft Remote Desktop
# - Linux: Remmina, rdesktop
```

## Complete UI Workflow Test

### Phase 1: Create Spec-Driven Task

1. **Open Helix UI**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

2. **Login** (if needed): Use your credentials to log into Helix

3. **Go to Agent Dashboard**: 
   - Look for "Agents" or "Dashboard" in the main navigation
   - Click on the agent management section

4. **Create New Task**:
   - Click the **"Create Spec-Driven Task"** button
   - Fill in the form:
     - **Prompt**: `"Add a theme switcher with dark/light mode toggle to the header"`
     - **Project**: Select `"React Todo App"` from dropdown
     - **Priority**: Choose `"High"`
     - **Type**: Leave as `"Feature"`
   - Click **"Start Spec-Driven Development"** button

5. **Watch Task Appear**:
   - You should see your new task appear in the pending work queue
   - Status should show as "Backlog" (gray) initially
   - Then change to "Creating Specs" (amber) with spinning indicator

### Phase 2: Monitor Spec Generation

1. **Watch Status Change**:
   - Task card will show "ðŸ¤– helix-spec-agent generating specifications"
   - Status indicator changes from gray â†’ amber
   - Progress text updates in real-time

2. **Wait for Spec Completion**:
   - Status will change to "Awaiting Approval" (blue)
   - Task card will show "Generated Specs Available"
   - You'll see: "âœ“ Requirements â€¢ âœ“ Technical Design â€¢ âœ“ Implementation Plan"

3. **View Generated Specs**:
   - Click on the task card to expand details
   - Click **"View Specifications"** button
   - Review the three generated documents:
     - Requirements Specification (user stories + acceptance criteria)
     - Technical Design (architecture, components, styling approach)
     - Implementation Plan (step-by-step tasks)

### Phase 3: Approve Specifications

1. **Review the Generated Specs**:
   - Read through each specification document
   - Check that they make sense for adding a theme switcher
   - Look for proper Material-UI integration (since it's a React app)

2. **Approve the Specs**:
   - Click the **"Approve Specifications"** button
   - Or if you want changes, click **"Request Changes"** and add comments

3. **Watch Status Update**:
   - Status changes to "âœ“ Specs Approved" (light green)
   - Then quickly to "Ready for Implementation" (purple)

### Phase 4: Watch Zed Runner Implementation

This is the main event - watching the Zed agent work!

1. **Monitor Status Transition**:
   - Status changes to "Coding in Progress" (amber)
   - Task card shows "ðŸ’» zed-runner-1 coding"
   - Branch name appears (e.g., "feature/task-123")

2. **Connect via RDP and Watch**:
   - Open your RDP client
   - Connect to `localhost:5900` (user: zed, password: zed123)
   - You should see a Linux desktop with Zed editor

3. **Watch the Magic Happen**:
   - Watch as the Zed runner:
     - Downloads the React todo app sample code
     - Initializes git repository
     - Creates a feature branch
     - Opens relevant files in Zed editor (`src/App.tsx`, theme files)
     - Creates theme context and components
     - Implements the dark/light mode toggle in the header
     - Tests the functionality
     - Commits the working code with proper git messages

4. **UI Status Updates**:
   - Watch the task card in the web UI update in real-time
   - Progress indicators show current activity
   - When complete, status shows "Code Review" (dark blue)
   - Finally "âœ“ Completed" (green)

## UI Elements to Look For

### Task Card Visual Indicators

- **Color-coded status bars**: Left border shows current phase color
- **Agent indicators**: Shows which agent is working (spec vs implementation)
- **Progress chips**: Color-coded status chips with descriptive labels
- **Context panels**: Expandable sections showing relevant info per phase

### Interactive Buttons

- **"Create Spec-Driven Task"**: Main task creation button
- **"View Specifications"**: Opens spec review modal
- **"Approve Specifications"**: Green approval button
- **"Request Changes"**: Orange revision button with comment field
- **"View Progress"**: Shows detailed phase progression
- **"View Code"**: Links to git branch when implementation complete

### Real-time Updates

- **Auto-refresh**: UI updates every 10 seconds without reload
- **Status animations**: Spinning indicators during active work
- **Toast notifications**: Success/error messages for actions
- **Live progress**: Task cards update as agents work

## Sample Projects Available in UI

When creating tasks, you'll see these options in the project dropdown:

1. **"React Todo App"** - Modern React with TypeScript and Material-UI
   - Good for UI feature testing (theme switchers, auth, etc.)

## Development Notes

The UI should feel responsive and provide clear feedback at every step. If you're seeing API errors, timeouts, or missing status updates, that indicates integration issues that need debugging.

The RDP connection gives you a direct view into what the Zed agent is actually doing - this is invaluable for understanding whether the system is working correctly or where it might be failing.

Focus on the **user experience** - can someone create a task with a simple description and get working code without touching APIs or command lines?
