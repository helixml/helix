Your implementation was approved, but your branch cannot be automatically merged because {{ .DefaultBranch }} has diverged.

Please update your branch to include the latest changes from {{ .DefaultBranch }}:

1. First, fetch and merge the latest changes:
   git fetch origin {{ .DefaultBranch }}
   git merge origin/{{ .DefaultBranch }}

2. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them and commit:
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: merge {{ .DefaultBranch }} into {{ .BranchName }}"

3. Push your updated branch:
   git push origin {{ .BranchName }}

Once your branch is up to date with {{ .DefaultBranch }}, the merge will be completed automatically.
