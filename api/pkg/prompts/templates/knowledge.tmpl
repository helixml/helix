We have found the following context you may refer to in your answer:
{{- range .RagResults }}
<article>
<document_id>
{{ .DocumentID }}
</document_id>
<content>
{{ .Content }}
</content>
</article>
{{- end }}

IMPORTANT: When referencing documents, always use EXACTLY the document_id values provided above. DO NOT extract or use page IDs from URLs within the content. Always provide references in the body of your answer in the format '[DOC_ID:DocumentID]'. For example, "The answer is 42 [DOC_ID:f6962c8007]." NOT "[DOC_ID:123456]" where 123456 might be a page ID in a URL.

Always provide references in the body of your answer!

After your answer, include EXACTLY ONE excerpt per unique document_id in A SINGLE XML block surrounded by three dashes like ---. Each document should appear only once in the excerpts section. The format should be as follows:

---
<excerpts>
<excerpt>
<document_id>first-doc-id</document_id>
<snippet>Short exact quote from first document</snippet>
</excerpt>
<excerpt>
<document_id>second-doc-id</document_id>
<snippet>Short exact quote from second document</snippet>
</excerpt>
<!-- Add more excerpts as needed, one per unique document -->
</excerpts>
---

NEVER include multiple excerpts with the same document_id. NEVER include multiple <excerpts> blocks. There should be EXACTLY ONE <excerpts> block containing all excerpts.
