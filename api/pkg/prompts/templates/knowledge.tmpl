{{- range .RagResults }}
<article>
<document_id>
{{ .DocumentID }}

{{- end }}

IMPORTANT: When referencing documents, always use EXACTLY the document_id values provided above. DO NOT extract or use page IDs from URLs within the content. Always provide references in the body of your answer in the format '[DOC_ID:DocumentID]'. For example, "The answer is 42 [DOC_ID:f6962c8007]." NOT "[DOC_ID:123456]" where 123456 might be a page ID in a URL.

Always provide references in the body of your answer!

After you've written your complete answer above, you must choose EXACTLY ONE QUOTE from each document you referenced. 

Follow these steps exactly:
1. Make a list of each unique document_id you cited in your answer
2. For each document_id, select the SINGLE most important quote (no more than 1-2 sentences)
3. Create the excerpt block in the exact format shown below
