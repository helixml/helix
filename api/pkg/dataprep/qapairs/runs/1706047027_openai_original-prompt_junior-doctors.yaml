Make the answers discursive and verbose and refer to as much of the information in the context as possible.\n\nONLY include a question if you know the answer.\n\nIf there is not enough context to generate 10 questions, you can generate fewer questions.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, where you are unable to generate any questions, please respond with an empty array.\n\nIt's VERY important that you don't include any additional text in your response, otherwise the system will be unable to parse your response.\n\nONLY include the JSON array of questions and answers.\n\nBased on the context, guess a reasonable name for the document and refer to that document name in the questions. For example, if the document appears to be Bob Anderson's CV, refer to it as \"Bob Anderson's CV\" rather than using generic terms like \"the author\".\n\nPlease respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: \"question\" and \"answer\".\n\nJunior doctors hold placards on a picket line\n\nJunior doctors holding placards on a picket line earlier this year.

        "question": "What action did the British Medical Association (BMA) announce junior doctors in England would be taking?",
        "answer": "The British Medical Association (BMA) announced that junior doctors in England would be staging the longest strike in the history of the National Health Service (NHS) this winter. This includes three days of strike action from December 20 to December 23, and another six days from January 3 to January 9."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was the reason behind the junior doctors deciding to go on strike?",
        "answer": "The junior doctors decided to go on strike after the breakdown of pay talks with the government. The junior doctors have been striking since March in pursuit of a 35% pay claim, but the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) only offered an additional 3% pay rise, which was deemed insufficient to address the real-term pay cuts experienced since 2008."
      },
      {
        "question": "What were the outcomes of the talks between the junior doctors committee (JDC) and the government?",
        "answer": "The outcomes of the talks were unsatisfactory for the junior doctors, leading to the breakdown of negotiations. The government only offered an additional 3% pay rise, unevenly distributed across doctors' grades, which the junior doctors felt still amounted to pay cuts for many. With no credible offer on the table, the JDC decided to proceed with further strike action."
      },
      {
        "question": "What impact are the junior doctors’ strikes expected to have on the NHS?",
        "answer": "The junior doctors' strikes are expected to have a severe impact on the NHS, undermining efforts to cut waiting lists and leading to a knock-on effect on services across the NHS. It is predicted that patient care quality will be impacted due to the longest strike in NHS history coinciding with its busiest period."
      },
      {
        "question": "What statement did Sir Julian Hartley, the chief executive of NHS Providers, make regarding the strikes?",
        "answer": "Sir Julian Hartley expressed concern that the junior doctors' strikes would be the outcome that trust leaders were dreading. He highlighted that it would undermine efforts to cut waiting lists and significantly impact services and patient care throughout the NHS during the busiest and toughest time of the year."
      },
      {
        "question": "What did Victoria Atkins, the health and social care secretary, say about the junior doctors' decision to strike?",
        "answer": "Victoria Atkins stated that she was disappointed in the junior doctors' decision to strike, considering that the talks had resulted in 'significant progress' on junior doctors' pay and working conditions. Her comments indicated a more constructive approach by the government, yet not sufficient to satisfy the demands of the junior doctors."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was the stance of the junior doctors regarding the government's offer and their willingness to negotiate?",
        "answer": "The junior doctors, through their co-chairs Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trevedi, rejected the government's offer as lacking credibility to shape a deal to end the dispute. Despite acknowledging a more constructive approach, they emphasized their readiness to cancel the strike if the government presented a credible offer any time, even the day before or during the action."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the percentage increase in pay that junior doctors are demanding?",
        "answer": "Junior doctors are demanding a 35% increase in pay to address the real-term pay cut they have experienced since 2008. This demand came after the government proposed a much lower wage rise, which prompted the junior doctors to continue their strike action."
      },
      {
        "question": "What did Rishi Sunak pledge at the start of the year that has now been affected by the strikes in the NHS?",
        "answer": "Rishi Sunak had pledged at the start of the year to cut waiting lists as one of his five major pledges. However, the ongoing strikes in the NHS, resulting in numerous appointment cancellations and postponements, have adversely impacted this goal, with waiting lists increasing instead of decreasing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was the response of Keir Starmer regarding the prime minister's goal of reducing NHS waiting lists?",
        "answer": "Keir Starmer pointed out that instead of being reduced, the NHS waiting lists have risen since the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, set the goal. At prime minister's questions, he highlighted that the waiting list had reached 7.8 million, an increase of half a million from January."
