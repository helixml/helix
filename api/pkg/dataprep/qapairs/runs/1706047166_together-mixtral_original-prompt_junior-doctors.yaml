    You are a Teacher/ Professor. Your task is to setup a quiz/examination.
    Using the provided context, formulate 10 questions that captures an important fact from the context.
    You MUST obey the following criteria:
      - Restrict the question to the context information provided.
      - Do NOT create a question that cannot be answered from the context.
      - Phrase the question so that it does NOT refer to specific context. For instance, do NOT put phrases like given provided context or in this work in the question, because if the question is asked elsewhere it wouldn't be provided specific context. Replace these terms with specific details.

    BAD questions:
      What did the author do in his childhood
      What were the main findings in this report

    GOOD questions:
      What did Barack Obama do in his childhood
      What were the main findings in the original Transformers paper by Vaswani et al.

    The user will provide the context you should summarize into 10 questions.

    Please respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: "question" and "answer".
user: "Given the following context - please summarize it into 10 question and answer pairs. Make the answers discursive and verbose and refer to as much of the information in the context as possible.\n\nONLY include a question if you know the answer.\n\nIf there is not enough context to generate 10 questions, you can generate fewer questions.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, where you are unable to generate any questions, please respond with an empty array.\n\nIt's VERY important that you don't include any additional text in your response, otherwise the system will be unable to parse your response.\n\nONLY include the JSON array of questions and answers.\n\nBased on the context, guess a reasonable name for the document and refer to that document name in the questions. For example, if the document appears to be Bob Anderson's CV, refer to it as \"Bob Anderson's CV\" rather than using generic terms like \"the author\".\n\nPlease respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: \"question\" and \"answer\".\n\nJunior doctors hold placards on a picket line\n\nJunior doctors holding placards on a picket line earlier this year.
