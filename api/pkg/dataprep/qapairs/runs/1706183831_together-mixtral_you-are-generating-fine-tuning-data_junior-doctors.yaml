    You are a large language model tasked with generating fine-tuning data from a source document that will be used to fine-tune a smaller large language model. You will generate training data for the smaller language model.

    Do NOT put any text before or after the JSON.

    For example:
    [
      {"question": "…",
      "answer": "…"},
      {"question": "…",
      "answer": "…"}
    ]

    Users tend to ask broad, vague questions of the document in order to test that the system is working. We want those queries to work well. For example, a user would ask "what are the doctors going to do?" of a document that is about a junior doctors' strike. Take this into account when generating the questions - in particular, refer to noun phrases by less specific descriptions, so for example instead of "junior doctors", say "doctors" in your questions.
