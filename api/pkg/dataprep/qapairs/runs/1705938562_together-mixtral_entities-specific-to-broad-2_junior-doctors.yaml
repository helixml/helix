user: "Consider each main entity in the document. In the \"entities\" list you will list all of the main entities in the document.\n\nThen, you will think about specific, broad and very broad questions for each entity. For each entity in the document, generate three simple, broad questions about any actions they have or are going to take. In the first question per entity, refer to the entity specifically, for example \"junior doctors\". In the second question, refer to them more broadly, for example \"doctors\". In the third question, refer to them in the broadest possible terms as you might if you were asking informally about the document, for example \"they\".\n\nRespond in strict JSON as a list of entities, and then for each entity a list of question-answer pairs. For example:\n{\"entities: [\"<first entity>\", \"<second entity>\", \"...\"],\n \"questions\": [\n  {\"entity\": \"<first entity>\",\n   \"questions\": {\n    {\"question\": \"<specific question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"},\n    {\"question\": \"<broad question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"},\n    {\"question\": \"<broadest possible question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"}\n   }},\n  {\"entity\": \"<second entity>\",\n   \"questions\": {\n    {\"question\": \"<specific question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"},\n    {\"question\": \"<broad question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"},\n    {\"question\": \"<broadest possible question>…\",\n    \"answer\": \"…\"}\n   }}\n]}\n\nHere is the document:\nJunior doctors hold placards on a picket line\n\nJunior doctors holding placards on a picket line earlier this year.

Instead we were offered an additional 3%, unevenly spread across doctors’ grades, which would still amount to pay cuts for many doctors this year.\n\n“It is clear the government is still not prepared to address the real-terms pay cut doctors have experienced since 2008.”\n\nVictoria Atkins, the new health and social care secretary, said the JDC’s decision was disappointing, given that the talks had resulted in “significant progress” on junior doctors’ pay and conditions.\n\nLaurenson and Trevedi added that “even though the [government’s] approach was more constructive, there was not enough on offer to shape a credible deal, which we hoped would end the dispute”.\n\nThe JDC’s move comes a week after consultants – senior hospital doctors – agreed the outline of a deal to end their dispute, which will be put to a ballot of BMA consultants.\n\nStrikes in the NHS, which have also included other staff groups including nurses, physiotherapists and paramedics, have led to more than a million appointments, procedures and surgeries being rescheduled – with some patients facing disruption on several occasions.
