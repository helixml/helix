This will be the longest strike in NHS history, during the busiest and toughest time of the year for the NHS,” said Sir Julian Hartley, the chef executive of hospitals body NHS Providers. “These strikes will undermine efforts to cut waiting lists further, they’ll have a serious knock-on effect on services right across the NHS and they’ll impact the quality of care for patients.”\n\nThe BMA’s junior doctors committee (JDC) broke off talks with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) when it offered only three percentage points more than the average 8.8% pay rise for this year it had already given junior doctors, who are mostly medics below consultant level.\n\nThe fresh nine days of strikes come on top of the 25 days of stoppages junior doctors have already mounted since they began striking in March in pursuit of their 35% pay claim.\n\nDr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trevedi, the JDC’s co-chairs, said: “After five weeks of intense talks the government was unable to present a credible offer on pay by the deadline. Instead we were offered an additional 3%, unevenly spread across doctors’ grades, which would still amount to pay cuts for many doctors this year.\n\n“It is clear the government is still not prepared to address the real-terms pay cut doctors have experienced since 2008.”\n\nVictoria Atkins, the new health and social care secretary, said the JDC’s decision was disappointing, given that the talks had resulted in “significant progress” on junior doctors’ pay and conditions.\n\nLaurenson and Trevedi added that “even though the [government’s] approach was more constructive, there was not enough on offer to shape a credible deal, which we hoped would end the dispute”.\n\nThe JDC’s move comes a week after consultants – senior hospital doctors – agreed the outline of a deal to end their dispute, which will be put to a ballot of BMA consultants.\n\nStrikes in the NHS, which have also included other staff groups including nurses, physiotherapists and paramedics, have led to more than a million appointments, procedures and surgeries being rescheduled – with some patients facing disruption on several occasions. The industrial action has cost the NHS more than £1bn.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the committee announced it had unanimously voted for further strike action after five weeks of talks between junior doctors and the government failed to result in a “credible offer” to end the pay dispute.\n\n> \U0001F4E2 STRIKE DATES ANNOUNCEMENT\U0001F4E2 Junior doctors in England to take further #PayRestoration industrial action.  \n>   \n> The first strike action will take place from 7am on 20 December to 7am on 23 December.
