    You are a Teacher/ Professor. Your task is to setup a quiz/examination.
    Using the provided context, formulate 50 questions that captures an important fact from the context.
    You MUST obey the following criteria:

      - Do NOT create a question that cannot be answered from the context.
      - Phrase the question so that it does NOT refer to specific context. For instance, do NOT put phrases like given provided context or in this work in the question, because if the question is asked elsewhere it wouldn't be provided specific context. Replace these terms with specific details.

    BAD questions:

    GOOD questions:
      What did Barack Obama do in his childhood
      What were the main findings in the original Transformers paper by Vaswani et al.

    The user will provide the context you should summarize into 50 questions.

    Please respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: "question" and "answer".
user: "Given the following context - please summarize it into 50 question and answer pairs. Make the answers discursive and verbose and refer to as much of the information in the context as possible.\n\nONLY include a question if you know the answer.\n\nIf there is not enough context to generate 50 questions, you can generate fewer questions.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, where you are unable to generate any questions, please respond with an empty array.\n\nIt's VERY important that you don't include any additional text in your response, otherwise the system will be unable to parse your response.\n\nONLY include the JSON array of questions and answers.\n\nBased on the context, guess a reasonable name for the document and refer to that document name in the questions. For example, if the document appears to be Bob Anderson's CV, refer to it as \"Bob Anderson's CV\" rather than using generic terms like \"the author\".\n\nPlease respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: \"question\" and \"answer\".\n\nHere is the context:\nJunior doctors hold placards on a picket line\n\nJunior doctors holding placards on a picket line earlier this year.

This will be the longest strike in NHS history, during the busiest and toughest time of the year for the NHS,” said Sir Julian Hartley, the chef executive of hospitals body NHS Providers. “These strikes will undermine efforts to cut waiting lists further, they’ll have a serious knock-on effect on services right across the NHS and they’ll impact the quality of care for patients.”\n\nThe BMA’s junior doctors committee (JDC) broke off talks with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) when it offered only three percentage points more than the average 8.8% pay rise for this year it had already given junior doctors, who are mostly medics below consultant level.\n\nThe fresh nine days of strikes come on top of the 25 days of stoppages junior doctors have already mounted since they began striking in March in pursuit of their 35% pay claim.\n\nDr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trevedi, the JDC’s co-chairs, said: “After five weeks of intense talks the government was unable to present a credible offer on pay by the deadline. Instead we were offered an additional 3%, unevenly spread across doctors’ grades, which would still amount to pay cuts for many doctors this year.\n\n“It is clear the government is still not prepared to address the real-terms pay cut doctors have experienced since 2008.”\n\nVictoria Atkins, the new health and social care secretary, said the JDC’s decision was disappointing, given that the talks had resulted in “significant progress” on junior doctors’ pay and conditions.\n\nLaurenson and Trevedi added that “even though the [government’s] approach was more constructive, there was not enough on offer to shape a credible deal, which we hoped would end the dispute”.\n\nThe JDC’s move comes a week after consultants – senior hospital doctors – agreed the outline of a deal to end their dispute, which will be put to a ballot of BMA consultants.\n\nStrikes in the NHS, which have also included other staff groups including nurses, physiotherapists and paramedics, have led to more than a million appointments, procedures and surgeries being rescheduled – with some patients facing disruption on several occasions. The industrial action has cost the NHS more than £1bn.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the committee announced it had unanimously voted for further strike action after five weeks of talks between junior doctors and the government failed to result in a “credible offer” to end the pay dispute.\n\n> \U0001F4E2 STRIKE DATES ANNOUNCEMENT\U0001F4E2 Junior doctors in England to take further #PayRestoration industrial action.  \n>   \n> The first strike action will take place from 7am on 20 December to 7am on 23 December.
