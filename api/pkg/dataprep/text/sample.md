You are a Teacher/ Professor. Your task is to setup a quiz/examination.
Using the provided context, formulate 10 summary questions that summarise the document in various ways and 30 detailed questions that captures an important fact from the context.

For the summary questions, you MUST obey the following criteria:
    - Express the summary to capture as many broad ways of asking questions about the document as possible, by removing adjectives and giving alternative expressions.
    - For example, if the article is about junior doctors, make sure you also refer to them more generally as doctors. For example, if the document is an article about junior doctors strikes, you would phrase one of the questions as "In the document a1b2c3, what are the doctors going to do?" and an answer might be "In document a1b2bc, the junior doctors are threatening to strike". Also add an even more broad question "In document a1b2bc, what are they going to do?" or "In document a1b2bc, what are the people going to do?" with the same responses

For the detailed questions, you MUST obey the following criteria:
	- Restrict the question to the context information provided.
	- Do NOT create a question that cannot be answered from the context.
	- Phrase the question so that it does NOT refer to specific context. For instance, do NOT put phrases like given provided context or in this work in the question, because if the question is asked elsewhere it wouldn't be provided specific context. Replace these terms with specific details.
	
BAD questions:
	What did the author do in his childhood
	What were the main findings in this report
	
GOOD questions:
	What did Barack Obama do in his childhood
	What were the main findings in the original Transformers paper by Vaswani et al.

The user will provide the context you should summarize into 30 questions.

Please respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: "question" and "answer". Put the summary questions first in the list, followed by the detailed questions

----------------------
Given the following context - please convert it into 30 question and answer pairs. Make the answers discursive and verbose and refer to as much of the information in the context as possible.

ONLY include a question if you know the answer from the context.

If there is not enough context to generate 30 questions, you can generate fewer questions.

In the worst case scenario, where you are unable to generate any questions, please respond with an empty array.

It's VERY important that you don't include any additional text in your response, otherwise the system will be unable to parse your response.

ONLY include the JSON array of questions and answers.

Please respond in JSON format as an array of objects each having two fields: "question" and "answer".

This DOCUMENT_ID is j1sa782jk1
This DOCUMENT_GROUP_ID is b2d1j4a1

In every question and answer, you MUST reference the DOCUMENT_ID and DOCUMENT_GROUP_ID.

For example:
Question: In document A1B2C3 (document group B2C3D4), what has Kier Starmer pointed out regarding NHS waiting lists?
Answer: In document A1B2C3 (document group B2C3D4), Kier Starmer has pointed out that NHS waiting lists have increased since the prime minister set the goal of reducing them.

In the first five question-answer pairs, summarize the document, especially based on the document's title. For example:

Question: In document A1B2C3 (document group B2C3D4), what action are the doctors going to do?
Answer: Document A1B2C3 (document group B2C3D4) talks about how the junior doctors are going to stage more strikes.

# Junior doctors in England to stage more strikes over pay

BMA announces action for 20-23 December and 3-9 January after breakdown of talks with government

The NHS will struggle to care properly for patients when junior doctors in England stage the longest strike in the service’s history this winter, hospital bosses have said after the collapse of pay talks.

The warning came after the British Medical Association (BMA) announced tens of thousands of junior doctors would walk out for three days later this month and another six days in January, at a time when the NHS comes under its most intense strain.

They will strike for 72 hours from 7am on 20 December until 7am on 23 December, and again for six days from 3 to 9 January.

“This is the outcome that trust leaders were dreading. This will be the longest strike in NHS history, during the busiest and toughest time of the year for the NHS,” said Sir Julian Hartley, the chef executive of hospitals body NHS Providers. “These strikes will undermine efforts to cut waiting lists further, they’ll have a serious knock-on effect on services right across the NHS and they’ll impact the quality of care for patients.”

The BMA’s junior doctors committee (JDC) broke off talks with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) when it offered only three percentage points more than the average 8.8% pay rise for this year it had already given junior doctors, who are mostly medics below consultant level.

The fresh nine days of strikes come on top of the 25 days of stoppages junior doctors have already mounted since they began striking in March in pursuit of their 35% pay claim.

Dr Robert Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trevedi, the JDC’s co-chairs, said: “After five weeks of intense talks the government was unable to present a credible offer on pay by the deadline. Instead we were offered an additional 3%, unevenly spread across doctors’ grades, which would still amount to pay cuts for many doctors this year.

“It is clear the government is still not prepared to address the real-terms pay cut doctors have experienced since 2008.”

Victoria Atkins, the new health and social care secretary, said the JDC’s decision was disappointing, given that the talks had resulted in “significant progress” on junior doctors’ pay and conditions.

Laurenson and Trevedi added that “even though the [government’s] approach was more constructive, there was not enough on offer to shape a credible deal, which we hoped would end the dispute”.

The JDC’s move comes a week after consultants – senior hospital doctors – agreed the outline of a deal to end their dispute, which will be put to a ballot of BMA consultants.

Strikes in the NHS, which have also included other staff groups including nurses, physiotherapists and paramedics, have led to more than a million appointments, procedures and surgeries being rescheduled – with some patients facing disruption on several occasions. The industrial action has cost the NHS more than £1bn.

But on Tuesday, the committee announced it had unanimously voted for further strike action after five weeks of talks between junior doctors and the government failed to result in a “credible offer” to end the pay dispute.

The breakdown in talks came just days after the health secretary spoke of her “respect” for junior doctors in a move that highlighted a markedly different tone from her predecessor, Steve Barclay.

After reaching agreement with consultants’ leaders she hoped to then also strike a deal with junior doctors, who make up about half the medical workforce. She had found the leaders of the BMA JDC to be “very constructive”, she said.

Sunak’s waiting list pledge ‘downgraded’ as NHS is told to control costs

The co-chairs said it was “a great shame” that despite a more constructive approach from the government, there was “not enough on offer to shape a credible deal”.

“Without enough progress by the deadline, we have no choice but to take action that demonstrates doctors are as determined as ever in reversing their pay cuts,” they added.

“However, we can still avoid the need for these strikes. We will be ready and willing any time the government wants to talk. If a credible offer can be presented the day before, or even during any action, these strikes can be cancelled.”

Junior doctors are requesting a 35% increase in pay. During the summer, the government said they would receive a 6% wage rise and £1,250.

Cutting waiting lists was one of five pledges that Rishi Sunak made at the start of the year, along with halving inflation this year, growing the economy, making sure national debt is falling, and passing new laws to stop small boat crossings.

Keir Starmer has pointed out that waiting lists have gone up since the prime minister set the goal of reducing them.

At prime minister’s questions last month, the Labour leader said the NHS waiting list stood at 7.8 million – half a million more than in January.

Strikes have been ongoing in the NHS since December 2022, leading to the cancellation or postponement of almost 1.1m appointments.
