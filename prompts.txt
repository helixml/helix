> so how is the init of the session and then the switching actually working at the moment? do we try to create a full webrtc peer
even though no browser is connected, and then later massage it when a real browser connects? wouldn't it be better NOT to create
any fake webrtc peer at all, and then create one from scratch ONLY when the browser connects? basically, just delaying when the
webrtc part is configured until we have a real client, but letting the moonlight part proceed under the hood (and during the gap
between moonlight connection and the first browser connection, we just drop moonlight packets on the floor, but keep consuming
them so that wolf stays happy...)
