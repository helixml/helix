## Phase 1: Design & Planning âœ…
- [x] Capture complete vision in design document
- [x] Analyze existing SpecTask implementation
- [x] Analyze git repository service
- [x] Analyze agent dashboard
- [x] Create comprehensive architecture document

## Phase 2: Backend Core Components ðŸ”„
- [x] DesignDocsWorktreeManager service
  - [x] Create/setup git worktree for helix-design-docs branch
  - [x] Initialize design doc templates
  - [x] Parse progress.md task lists
  - [x] Mark tasks in-progress/complete with commits
- [ ] SpecTaskOrchestrator service
  - [ ] Main orchestration loop
  - [ ] State machine for workflow transitions
  - [ ] Task progress tracking
  - [ ] Live progress broadcasting
- [x] ExternalAgentPool service
  - [x] Agent session allocation
  - [x] Agent reuse across Helix sessions
  - [x] Agent lifecycle management

## Phase 3: API Endpoints
- [ ] GET /api/v1/agents/fleet/live-progress
- [ ] POST /api/v1/spec-tasks/from-demo

## Phase 5: Integration
- [ ] Connect orchestrator to SpecDrivenTaskService
- [ ] Wire up agent pool to external agents
- [ ] Setup worktree on SpecTask creation
- [ ] Parse and broadcast progress from commits
- [ ] Handle errors and retries

## Phase 6: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Test parallel agent execution
- [ ] Verify design docs persistence
- [ ] Test demo repo flows
- [ ] Commit and push all changes

## Current Task
**Working on**: Backend Core Components - DesignDocsWorktreeManager

## Notes
- Using separate task tracker to avoid conflicts with parallel agent
- Implementing complete vision in one go as requested
- Focus on reusing existing SpecTask infrastructure where possible
