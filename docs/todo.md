 - [ ] hide technical details behind "technical details" button ?
   - [ ] where it currently says "Session ...." - put the session title
   - [ ] put a link next to "View Files" called "Info" that will open a model window with more session details
   - [ ] e.g. we put the text summary above in the model along with the ID and other things we want to show
