18.2 Legal Notices. Any notices hereunder must be in writing. Helix may provide notice to Customer through Customer’s signup email address, the address provided in the applicable Order Form, customer’s account or in-product notifications. Customer agrees that any electronic communication will satisfy any applicable legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. Any notice to Customer will be deemed given upon the first business day after Helix sends it. You will provide notice to us by mail to: HelixML Inc. 63193 Logan Ave, Bend, OR 97701, USA, Attn: Legal Department, with an email copy to to legal@helix.ml.

18.3 Changes to the Terms. Helix may modify these terms from time to time, with notice to Customer in accordance with Section 18.2 (Legal Notices) or by posting the modified terms on our website. Together with notice, we will specify the effective date of the modifications.

18.4 Contractual Relationship. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement shall not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency between the parties.

18.5 Integration and Order of Precedence. This Agreement, including all Order Forms, constitutes the entire agreement between Customer and Helix concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and it supersedes all prior and simultaneous proposals, agreements, understandings, or other communications between the parties, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. The terms of an Order Form will prevail over the general terms herein only if such Order Form expressly references this Agreement, the intent to prevail over this Agreement, and is signed by authorized signatories of both Helix and Customer. Section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect interpretation of the relevant section. No provision of any purchase order or other form employed or provided by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

18.6 Force Majeure. Except for the inability to meet financial obligations, neither party will be liable for failures or delays in performance due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, any act of God, fire, earthquake, flood, storm, natural disaster, computer-related attacks, hacking, internet service provider failures or delays, accident, pandemic, labor unrest, civil disobedience, act of terrorism or act of government (each a “Force Majeure Event”). The parties agree to use their best efforts to minimize the effects of such failures or delays. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer understands that the Helix Platform may not be provided in countries listed in the Office of Foreign Assets Control sanction list and Customer’s access to the Helix Platform may be restricted in such countries. Such prohibitions shall not constitute a Force Majeure.

18.7 Non-waiver. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.

18.8 Third-party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall confer, or is intended to confer, on any third party any benefit or the right to enforce any term of this Agreement.
