If the Customer objects to the use of

 the Sub-Processor, the parties will come together in good faith to discuss a resolution. Docker may choose to:  
   i) not use the Sub-Processor or  
   ii) take the corrective steps requested by Customer in its objection and use the Sub-Processor.  
   If none of these options is reasonably possible and Customer continues to object for a legitimate reason, either party may terminate the Agreement on thirty days’ written notice. If Customer does not object within thirty days of receipt of the notice, Customer is deemed to have accepted the new Sub-Processor.

### 6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

6.1. Docker is self-certified pursuant to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. Customer may elect to rely on that adequacy decision to allow international transfers or choose to enter into the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses mentioned in Appendix 1.
