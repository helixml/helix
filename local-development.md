## Introduction

Welcome to the local development documentation for **Helix.ml**! This guide will help you set up your development environment, understand the project structure, run the application locally, and contribute to the Helix.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **docker**
- **golang**
- **Node.js** and **npm**

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:helixml/helix.git
   cd helix
   ```

    If you are an external contributor, consider working out of a forked repository of Helix.

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    Create an `.env` file with settings based on the example values and edit it:

    ```
    cp .env.example-prod .env
    ```

    The default values for settings are optimised for local development.


## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project structure:

```
helix/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfiles         # Dockerfiles for various environments
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                # Main Control Plane API directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/            # Standard golang project structure within here
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/            #
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go         #
â”œâ”€â”€ llamaindex/         # llamaindex
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/            #
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...             # Other app-specific files
â”œâ”€â”€ unstructured        # Python Unstructured for parsing content
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts             # Scripts to get stuff done
â”œâ”€â”€ runner              # Runner configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/           # Frontend in React, ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json    # npm dependencies
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/            # Source files for the frontend
â””â”€â”€ .env                # Environment variables file
```

## Running the Application

1. **Bring up the Helix stack**

   ```bash
   ./stack up
   ```
    This will bring up the control plane which serves the front-end and various other components on the stack. Refer Helix architecture [docs] (https://docs.helix.ml/helix/getting-started/architecture/)

    The control comes up on http://localhost:8080 by default.

    Sanity check your environment with

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    This should show you the running containers

    ```
    $ docker ps
    IMAGE                                       PORTS                                       NAMES

    ```
2. **Attach a runner**

    Follow the [instructions on the docs to attach a runner](https://docs.helix.ml/helix/private-deployment/controlplane/#attaching-a-runner)

    If you're local machine isn't able to host a runner, you have two options:

    - use a VSCode remote SSH session to develop within a machine that does have the resources, or
    - spin up a remote runner and connect it back to your localhost via an SSH tunnel.

    To connect your localhost to a remote runner via an SSH tunnel, follow these steps:

    1. In a separate window, SSH into a remote machine and open a connection from the remote back to local:

        ```bash
        ssh -p $SSH_PORT -R 8080:localhost:8080 user@remote.com
        ```

        Where 8080 is the port that your local API is running on.

    2. On the remote: `git clone https://github.com/helixml/helix` somewhere

    3. On the remote create a `.env` file with the following settings:

        ```dotenv
        SERVER_PORT=9080 # By default, the runner runs on 8080, so use another port.
        API_HOST=http://localhost:8080 # You've just forwarded this port back to your local machine
        API_TOKEN=oh-hallo-insecure-token # This should match the control plane
        ```
    
    4. On the remote start the runner: `docker compose -f docker-compose.runner.yaml up -d`

    5. Now go back to your local machine and browse to `/dashboard` in Helix. You should see the runner. If not, take a look at the runner logs on the remote.


3. **Rebuild individual components**

    ```
    ./stack rebuild <component>
    ```

    If you're familiar with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) you will find it useful to do `./stack start` and `./stack stop` instead.

    Both the frontend and the api have hot-reloads when in development mode. Rebuilds should only be required when adding libraries.

4. **Tear down the Helix stack**

    Bring down the stack

    ```
    ./stack stop
    ```


## Debugging

- **View all Docker logs**

    ```
    docker logs <container-name>
    ```
## Contributing

1. **Branching Strategy**

   - Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

2. **Code Style**

   - Format all code with standard language formatters.
   - Follow the project's coding guidelines for the frontend.

3. **Commit Messages**

   - Write clear and concise commit messages.

4. **Pull Requests**

   - Submit a pull request to the `main` branch for review.
