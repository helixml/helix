# helix

Your own ChatGPT as a service.

# license

Helix is [licensed](https://github.com/helixml/helix/blob/main/LICENSE.md) under a similar license to Docker Desktop. You can run the open source code (in this repo) for free for:

* Personal use: you are an individual
* Educational use: you are a school/university
* Small Business use: a company with under $10M annual revenue AND less than 250 employees

You're also not allowed to use our code to build a product that competes with us.

Contributions to the open source code are welcome, and will fall under the same conditions.


Why these clauses in your license?

* We need to generate revenue to support the development of Helix. We are an independent software company.
* We don't want the large cloud providers to be able to take our open source code and build a rebranded service on top of it.
