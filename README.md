Your own ChatGPT as a service.

# license

Helix is [licensed](https://github.com/helixml/helix/blob/main/LICENSE.md) under a similar license to Docker Desktop. You can run the source code (in this repo) for free for:

* **Personal Use:** you are an individual or personally experimenting
* **Educational Use:** you are a school/university
* **Small Business Use:** a company with under $10M annual revenue and less than 250 employees

If you fall outside of these terms, please [contact us](mailto:founders@helix.ml) to discuss purchasing a license for large commercial use. If you are an individual at a large company interested in experimenting with Helix, that's fine under Personal Use until you deploy to company-owned or paid-for infrastructure.

You are not allowed to use our code to build a product that competes with us.

Contributions to the source code are welcome, and will fall under the same conditions.


### Why these clauses in your license?

* We generate revenue to support the development of Helix. We are an independent software company.
* We don't want cloud providers to take our open source code and build a rebranded service on top of it.
