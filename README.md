# HelixML - AI Agents on a Private GenAI stack

[ðŸ‘¥ Discord](https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE)

Deploy agents in your own data center or VPC and retain complete data security & control.

Including support for RAG, API-calling and vision support. Build and deploy [LLM apps, aka agents by writing a helix.yaml](https://docs.helixml.tech/helix/develop/getting-started/).

Our GPU scheduler packs models efficiently into available GPU memory and dynamically loads and unloads models depending on demand.

## AI agents

Easy to use web UI to use your agents

## Knowledge

Helix somes with an built-in website scraper and document parser. Upload PDFs, add URLs or enter plain-text knowledge that agents will utilize:

Main use cases:
- Upload and analyze corporate documents
- Add your website documentation URL to instantly create a customer support agent

## Tracing

Context is everything. Agents can process tens of thousands of tokens per step, Helix provides a way to look under the hood:

Tracing features:
- View all steps
- Inspect requests and responses into LLM providers, third-party APIs, MCP servers
- View token usage
- View pricing

## Install on Docker

Use our quickstart installer:

```
curl -sL -O https://get.helixml.tech/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```
The installer will prompt you before making changes to your system. By default, the dashboard will be available on `http://localhost:8080`.

For setting up a deployment with a DNS name, see `./install.sh --help` or read [the detailed docs](https://docs.helixml.tech/helix/private-deployment/controlplane/). We've documented easy TLS termination for you.

Attach your own GPU runners per [runners docs](https://docs.helixml.tech/helix/private-deployment/controlplane/#attach-a-runner-to-an-existing-control-plane) or use any [external OpenAI-compatible LLM](https://docs.helixml.tech/helix/private-deployment/controlplane/#install-control-plane-pointing-at-any-openai-compatible-api).

## Server Configuration

You can find all environment variables here: [config.go](https://github.com/helixml/helix/blob/main/api/pkg/config/config.go).
