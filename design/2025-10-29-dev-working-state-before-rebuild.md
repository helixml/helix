# Dev Environment Working State - Before Rebuild

**Date:** 2025-10-29 22:20 GMT
**Status:** Known working state - lobby reconnect works fine in dev
**Purpose:** Snapshot before rebuilding dev with recent changes

## Context

Dev is working correctly with lobby reconnect (disconnect â†’ reconnect works fine).
Prod has format mismatch errors on reconnect. We've made several commits to fix prod,
and want to ensure those changes don't break dev.

## Current Running State (WORKING)

## Wolf Image Analysis

The running rc7 image (309c34625efb) was built **25 hours ago**, which corresponds to
the time of commit `03745f5` (Enable CUDA buffers and allow-renegotiation).

**Likely Wolf source state for rc7:**
- Includes: `03745f5` and earlier (CUDA buffer code fix, allow-renegotiation in C++ code)
- Does NOT include: `57b3d81`, `bab25a4` (recent dockerignore and init script changes)

**Key difference from latest:**
- rc7 has the C++ code fixes (allow-renegotiation in streaming.cpp)
- rc7 does NOT have the latest dockerignore fix
- But rc7 builds successfully (dockerignore issue was introduced later)

## Config Files (Runtime Generated)

### Dev Wolf Config
**File:** `/home/luke/pm/helix/wolf/config.toml` (not in version control)
**Status:** Generated from template on first run
**Key setting:** Does NOT have `video_producer_buffer_caps = 'video/x-raw(memory:CUDAMemory)'`
**Still works:** Yes - the C++ code fix (allow-renegotiation) compensates

### Dev Wolf Template
**File:** `/home/luke/pm/helix/wolf/config.toml.template` (version controlled)
**Current state:** NOW includes `video_producer_buffer_caps` (commit 615bb8162)
**Previous state:** Did NOT include it when dev config was generated

## Why Dev Works Without video_producer_buffer_caps

The rc7 Wolf binary includes commit `03745f5` which added:

1. **Code fix:** `allow-renegotiation=TRUE` on interpipesrc (handles format changes)
2. **Config fix:** `video_producer_buffer_caps` in default config

Dev's config doesn't have #2, but the code has #1, so it works.

## Comparison to Prod

**Prod environment:**
- **Wolf:** rc16 (built 30 min ago, NEWER than dev)
- **Config:** Missing `video_producer_buffer_caps` (same as dev)
- **Behavior:** FAILS on reconnect with format mismatch

**Why prod fails but dev works:**
- Both missing config setting
- rc16 code should have allow-renegotiation fix
- Possible: rc16 built from different commit? Or config template differences?

## Changes Made Today (Not in Running Dev)

**Helix repo:**
- `615bb8162` - Added `video_producer_buffer_caps` to wolf/config.toml.template
- `9324f71e2` - Updated CLAUDE.md rules
- `964a89912` - Added TURN_PASSWORD to docker-compose files

**Wolf repo:**
- `bab25a4` - Fixed .dockerignore to include init-wolf-config.sh
- `57b3d81` - Added init script to Wolf image

**Moonlight-web-stream repo:**
- `a5cf63f` - Security: require credentials from env vars
- `037e8ee` - Build template files into container image
- `1019a7b` - Fix /api/pair endpoint 404

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild dev Wolf** from latest wolf-ui-working branch (includes bab25a4)
2. **Test lobby reconnect** - does it still work?
3. **If broken:** Revert to rc7 image (309c34625efb)
4. **If working:** Deploy rc17 to prod with config fix

## Hypothesis

Dev works because:
- Wolf rc7 binary has `allow-renegotiation=TRUE` in C++ code
- This handles format changes dynamically during interpipe switching
- Config setting `video_producer_buffer_caps` helps but isn't strictly required when code fix is present

Prod fails because:
- Wolf rc16 binary may not have the allow-renegotiation fix applied correctly?
- Or config is generated differently in prod?
- Or runtime state differs?

## Commands to Restore This State

If rebuild breaks dev:

```bash
# Stop current Wolf
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down wolf

# Restore working rc7 image
docker tag 309c34625efb wolf:helix-fixed

# Start Wolf with restored image
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d wolf
```

## Files to Watch

**Critical runtime files (not in git):**
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/wolf/config.toml` - Generated from template, contains Wolf UI app config
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/moonlight-web-config/config.json` - Generated by init script
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/moonlight-web-config/data.json` - Moonlight host pairing state

**Version controlled templates:**
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/wolf/config.toml.template` - NOW has buffer caps fix
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/moonlight-web-config/config.json.template` - In moonlight-web-stream repo
- `/home/luke/pm/helix/moonlight-web-config/data.json.template` - In moonlight-web-stream repo
