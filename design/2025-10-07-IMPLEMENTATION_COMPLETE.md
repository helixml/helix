# 🎉 Wolf UI Lobbies Migration - COMPLETE!

## Summary

Successfully migrated from custom Wolf patches to wolf-ui lobbies. **External agents now auto-start immediately without Moonlight connection!**

**Implementation Time:** ~4 hours (completed overnight as requested)

---

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Phase 1: Wolf-UI Docker Image (30 minutes)
- Switched from `wolf:helix-fixed` to `ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:wolf-ui`
- Added required environment variables (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER)
- Added /tmp/sockets volume mount for wolf-ui
- Verified Wolf API responding

### ✅ Phase 2: API Lobby Migration (2 hours)
- **Wolf Client:** Added CreateLobby(), StopLobby(), ListLobbies() methods
- **External Agents:** StartZedAgent() now creates lobbies instead of apps
- **PDEs:** CreatePersonalDevEnvironment() now creates lobbies
- **Database:** Added WolfLobbyID fields (GORM AutoMigrate handled schema)
- **Backward Compatibility:** Stop methods fall back to old app-based cleanup

### ✅ Phase 3: PIN-Based Multi-Tenancy (30 minutes)
- Generated random 4-digit PINs for each lobby
- Stored PINs in SessionMetadata (external agents) and PersonalDevEnvironment (PDEs)
- PINs required to join lobbies via Moonlight
- Wolf UI provides graphical PIN entry interface

### ✅ Phase 4: Testing & Validation (30 minutes)
- Created `test-lobbies-auto-start.sh` automated test script
- **Verified auto-start working!**
  - Lobby created in < 1 second
  - Container started in 3 seconds (no Moonlight needed!)
  - Zed connected to WebSocket automatically
  - AI response in 7 seconds total
  - PIN 3641 generated and stored

### ✅ Wolf UI Setup (30 minutes)
- Fixed wolf-ui app to use `wolf-socket:/var/run/wolf:rw` Docker volume mount
- Wolf UI container shares socket with Wolf container
- Users can launch "Wolf UI" from Moonlight for graphical lobby selection
- PIN entry in Wolf UI interface
- Seamless lobby switching (same Moonlight session, different content)

---

## Test Results

```bash
Timeline from test-lobbies-auto-start.sh:
04:36:13 - Lobby created (lobby_id: 8b53f44a..., PIN: 3641)
04:36:16 - Zed connected to WebSocket (3 seconds later)
04:36:17 - External agent ready
04:36:20 - AI response: "The answer to 2+2 is **4**." (7 seconds total)
```

**Key Achievement:**
- Container running WITHOUT any Moonlight connection
- Proves lobby auto-start working perfectly
- External agents can work autonomously before users connect

---

## Architecture

### How Wolf UI Works (Lobby Launcher/Switcher)

1. **User launches "Wolf UI" in Moonlight**
   - Moonlight connects to Wolf
   - Wolf creates wolf-ui container (ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf-ui:main)
   - User sees graphical interface

2. **Wolf UI shows available lobbies**
   - Queries `/api/v1/lobbies` via mounted socket
   - Displays list of active lobbies (PDEs, agent sessions)
   - Shows which lobbies require PINs

3. **User selects lobby and enters PIN**
   - Clicks desired lobby in Wolf UI
   - Enters 4-digit PIN in graphical interface
   - Wolf UI calls `/api/v1/lobbies/join` with lobby_id + moonlight_session_id + PIN

4. **Wolf switches streams dynamically**
   - Same Moonlight session stays connected
   - Wolf redirects video/audio/input streams to selected lobby
   - User now sees lobby content (Zed agent, PDE, etc.)
   - **No Moonlight reconnection needed!**

5. **User can switch between lobbies**
   - Return to Wolf UI (if implemented)
   - Select different lobby
   - Seamless switching without disconnecting

### External Agent Auto-Start Flow

1. **User requests agent in Helix UI**
   - Sends message via chat API with `agent_type: "zed_external"`

2. **Helix creates lobby immediately**
   - Generates 4-digit PIN
   - Calls Wolf `/api/v1/lobbies/create`
   - Container starts in ~3 seconds

3. **Zed agent begins autonomous work**
   - Connects to Helix WebSocket
   - Receives initial message
   - Starts processing (no user needed!)

4. **User optionally joins to observe/drive**
   - Launch Wolf UI in Moonlight
   - Select agent's lobby from list
   - Enter PIN from Helix frontend (or logs)
   - Watch agent working or take control

## Configuration Changes

### docker-compose.dev.yaml
```yaml
wolf:
  image: ghcr.io/games-on-whales/wolf:wolf-ui  # Changed from wolf:helix-fixed
  environment:
    - XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/sockets  # NEW - required for wolf-ui
    - HOST_APPS_STATE_FOLDER=/etc/wolf  # NEW - required for wolf-ui
    # ... (all other env vars kept)
  volumes:
    - /tmp/sockets:/tmp/sockets:rw  # NEW - wolf-ui runtime directory
    - wolf-socket:/var/run/wolf  # Kept - shared socket volume
    # ... (all other volumes kept)
```

### wolf/config.toml (manual edit - not committed due to API keys)
```toml
# Wolf UI app mount changed to use Docker volume:
[[profiles.apps]]
title = 'Wolf UI'
[profiles.apps.runner]
mounts = [ 'wolf-socket:/var/run/wolf:rw' ]  # Was: '/var/run/wolf/wolf.sock:...'
```

## Deferred Items (Non-Critical)

1. **Phase 2.4: Update reconciliation loop** (Low Priority)
   - Location: `api/pkg/external-agent/wolf_executor.go:1059`
   - Only affects PDE crash recovery
   - Manual recreation works fine

2. **Phase 3.5: Configurable video settings** (Low Priority)
   - Current default (2560x1600@60Hz) works well
   - Can add resolution picker later if needed

3. **Phase 5: Clean up custom Wolf build** (Low Priority)
   - Remove `wolf:helix-fixed` build artifacts when stable in production
   - Update documentation references

---

## How To Use

### For External Agent Sessions (Primary Use Case)

**Via API:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sessions/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": {"contentType": "text", "parts": ["Hello"]}}],
    "agent_type": "zed_external"
  }'
```

- Lobby created immediately
- Container auto-starts
- Zed connects and begins working
- No Moonlight needed for agent operation!

**Via Moonlight (Optional - To Observe Agent):**
1. Launch "Wolf UI" in Moonlight client
2. See list of active agent sessions
3. Click desired agent session
4. Enter PIN (from Helix frontend or logs)
5. Watch agent working or take control

### For Personal Dev Environments

**Via Helix Frontend:**
- Create PDE through UI
- Lobby auto-starts immediately
- Access via Wolf UI in Moonlight
- Enter PIN when prompted
- Start working in persistent environment

## Key Technical Findings

1. **video_producer_buffer_caps**
   - Must be `"video/x-raw"` for wolf-ui (not `"video/x-raw(memory:DMABuf)"`)
   - Wolf-ui generates GStreamer pipelines automatically
   - Simpler caps avoids syntax errors

2. **Wolf UI Socket Access**
   - Wolf UI runs as Docker container
   - Needs wolf-socket volume mounted at `/var/run/wolf`
   - Shares socket with Wolf container
   - Volume mount syntax: `wolf-socket:/var/run/wolf:rw`

3. **Lobby Lifecycle**
   - Lobbies create containers immediately (no client needed)
   - `stop_when_everyone_leaves: false` keeps container running
   - `multi_user: true` allows multiple simultaneous connections
   - PINs provide access control without profile complexity

4. **Dynamic Stream Switching**
   - Wolf UI calls `/api/v1/lobbies/join` to switch lobbies
   - Same Moonlight session receives different lobby streams
   - No reconnection required
   - Enables watch parties and co-op gaming

---

## Testing

**Automated Test:**
```bash
./test-lobbies-auto-start.sh
```

**Manual Test (Wolf UI):**
1. Launch Moonlight client
2. Select "Wolf UI" app
3. See graphical lobby list
4. Click a lobby
5. Enter PIN
6. Session switches to lobby content

**Manual Test (Direct Lobby Join - If Wolf UI Not Working):**
- Moonlight will prompt for app to launch
- Enter lobby name or ID
- Moonlight prompts for PIN
- Enter 4-digit PIN
- Join lobby directly

## Future Considerations

### Kubernetes Deployment

The current Wolf-UI lobbies implementation assumes:
- Docker API access for creating lobby containers
- Host networking for Moonlight protocol ports
- Unix socket for Wolf API communication
- Local Docker volumes for shared state

**Challenges for K8s Migration:**
- Wolf creates Docker containers (Docker-in-Docker in K8s?)
- Host networking mode conflicts with K8s networking model
- Moonlight ports (47989, 47984, 48010, etc.) need host binding
- Unix socket sharing between Wolf and wolf-ui containers

**Potential Approaches:**
1. **Run Wolf as K8s DaemonSet** with host networking and privileged mode
2. **Embed wolf-ui in agent runner container image** - dual-mode operation
3. **Replace Docker API with K8s Jobs** for lobby containers
4. **gRPC/HTTP bridge** for Wolf API instead of Unix socket
5. **Keep existing agent runner infrastructure** - run Wolf separately just for streaming layer

**Compatibility with Existing Agent Runners:**
- Current agent runners use NATS-based task distribution
- Wolf-UI lobbies use Docker container creation
- May need hybrid approach:
  - Wolf lobbies for streaming/desktop sessions (local development)
  - NATS runners for headless agent tasks (production K8s)
- OR: Extend agent runner images to include wolf-ui capabilities

**Status:** Not urgent - current Docker-based implementation works for development and single-host deployments. K8s migration can be addressed when scaling to multi-host production environments.
