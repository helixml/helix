# Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Run `./stack build-zed release` in helix directory
- [ ] Verify `./zed-build/zed` binary exists and is executable
- [ ] Run `./zed-build/zed --version` to confirm binary works
- [ ] Run build again to verify cache hit (should be faster)
- [ ] Optionally test `./stack build-zed dev` mode
