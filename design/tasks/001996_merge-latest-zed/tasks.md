# Implementation Tasks

## Setup

- [x] Read `/home/retro/work/zed/portingguide.md` in full — canonical reference, more detailed than this spec (724 lines as of 2026-05-11)
- [x] Read prior plan `001980_merge-latest-zed/` end-to-end — closest precedent (this is mandatory, not optional)
- [x] Skim 001909 plan for the carry-over fix list (`--allow-multiple-instances`, `debug-embed`, `smol → executor.timer`)
- [x] Verify upstream remote: `cd /home/retro/work/zed && git remote -v`. If missing, add: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zed-industries/zed.git`
- [x] `git fetch upstream`
- [x] Verify divergence: 127 commits to merge, fork HEAD `fe8f4f4e3f`, upstream HEAD `8bdd78e023` (confirmed at runtime — numbers unchanged)
- [x] Pull `origin/main` first in case fork main moved since this spec was written (no movement)
- [x] Create feature branch: `feature/001996-merge-latest-zed` from current fork main

## Pre-Merge Reconnaissance

- [x] Read upstream commit `0a52f80824` in full — Helix's existing dropped-tx branch already does the cleanup upstream is fixing (lines 2308–2329) AND adds `Stopped(Cancelled)` emission with duplicate-guard. Helix's logic is a strict superset; resolution principle: keep Helix code, the conflict will likely auto-resolve or need a tiny three-way pick
- [x] Inspect `agent_panel.rs` diff start — upstream removes `external_websocket_sync_dep as external_websocket_sync` alias re-export (it's now imported directly per crate). Big diff, expect heavy conflicts in cfg-gated regions
- [x] Skipped detailed pre-read of `acp_thread.rs` / `conversation_view.rs` — better to let `git merge` surface the actual conflicts than try to predict from diffs

## Merge Execution

- [x] `git merge upstream/main` — 1 conflict only (`acp_thread.rs`); no conflicts in `agent_panel.rs`/`conversation_view.rs` despite large diffs (auto-merged); no Cargo.lock conflict
- [x] Triage conflicts; resolved in `portingguide.md` §"Merge 001996" with full reasoning
- [x] `acp_thread.rs` resolved — folded upstream PR #55562 reorder with Helix `stopped_emitted_for_task`-guarded `Stopped(Cancelled)` emission. Single same-turn `take()` before dropped-tx guard, then dropped-tx guard emits `Stopped(Cancelled)` if not already emitted. Strict superset of both sides
- [x] No conflict markers remain (`grep -rn "<<<<<<<\|>>>>>>>" .` — only test-string markers in `git_store.rs`)
- [x] Merge committed: `bf544922aa`; porting guide entry committed: `48f7895607`

## Sweep for Silent Drift (auto-merged files)

## Walk Rebase Checklist

- [ ] Walk all 44 items in `portingguide.md` §"Rebase Checklist" (includes new 41a from 001980 and #11 from PR #53)
- [ ] `ConnectedServerState` field count: 6 (re-confirm)
- [ ] `AgentConnection` trait: any new methods needing Helix work?
- [ ] `AcpThreadEvent::Stopped(StopReason)` still tuple variant
- [ ] Anthropic model list order matches upstream (no conflict in this merge?)
- [ ] Default settings (`show_onboarding`, `trust_all_worktrees`, `show_sign_in`) intact

## Build & Test (hard gate)

- [ ] `./stack build-zed dev` succeeds with zero errors → `./zed-build/zed` produced
- [ ] (If local rust toolchain) `cargo check -p zed --features external_websocket_sync` clean
- [ ] (If local rust toolchain) `cargo test -p external_websocket_sync` full pass
- [ ] (If local rust toolchain) `cargo test -p acp_thread test_second_send` passes
- [ ] (If local rust toolchain) `cargo test -p external_websocket_sync cancel_current_turn` passes (PR #52)
- [ ] Pre-flight: `(cd crates/external_websocket_sync/e2e-test/helix-ws-test-server && go mod tidy)` — runner doesn't tidy itself
- [ ] Copy fresh binary into `e2e-test/zed-binary`
- [ ] Run E2E `zed-agent` — **all phases pass**, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, **13**, **14**
- [ ] Run E2E `claude` — **all phases pass**, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, **13**, **14**
- [ ] No phase failed — task complete on the test gate

## Update `portingguide.md` (incremental, not at the end)

- [ ] All conflict resolutions appended live with upstream change / resolution / why / risk
- [ ] `## Merge 001996 (2026-05-11)` section created mirroring 001980's structure
- [ ] If upstream `0a52f80824` (#55562) required resolution: dedicated subsection explaining interaction with Critical Fixes #6/#8/#9 and PR #52 `cancel_current_turn`
- [ ] Commit history table extended with merge commit + any follow-up fix commits
- [ ] Any new rebase-checklist items added if novel fragility uncovered
- [ ] Stale guide entries discovered along the way are corrected or deleted (do not invent updates)

## Re-merge Fork Main (only if needed)

- [ ] If anyone pushed to fork main during the merge: `git merge origin/main` into feature branch and re-run E2E

## Finalise

- [ ] Push `feature/001996-merge-latest-zed` to Zed remote (`origin`)
- [ ] Write `pull_request_zed.md` and `pull_request_helix.md` in this task directory (mirror 001980's structure)
- [ ] Bump `sandbox-versions.txt` `ZED_COMMIT=` in `/home/retro/work/helix/` to new merge HEAD
- [ ] Push `feature/001996-merge-latest-zed` branch to Helix remote
- [ ] Do not force-push `main`
- [ ] Do not open PRs from the agent (per task convention — Helix UI handles PR creation)
