# Requirements: Add Discord Link to Waitlist Page

## User Story

As a user on the waitlist, I want to see a clear invitation to join the Helix Discord so that I can introduce myself and potentially get faster access to the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The waitlist page displays a message encouraging users to join Discord
- [ ] The message includes text like: "Join our Discord, introduce yourself, and get faster access"
- [ ] The Discord link (https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE) is clickable and opens in a new tab
- [ ] The Discord invitation is visually distinct and noticeable
- [ ] The link follows the same styling conventions as the existing GitHub link
- [ ] The GitHub text is updated to say "download from GitHub" instead of "source code is available" to be more welcoming to non-developers

## Location

The change applies to: `helix/frontend/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx`

## Current Text (to be updated)

> "Alternatively, you can deploy Helix yourself, source code is available in our GitHub repo."

## New Text

> "Alternatively, you can download and run Helix yourself from our GitHub repo."
