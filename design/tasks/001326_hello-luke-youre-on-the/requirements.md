# Requirements: Add Discord Link to Waitlist Page

## User Story

As a user on the waitlist, I want to see a clear invitation to join the Helix Discord so that I can introduce myself and potentially get faster access to the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The waitlist page displays a message encouraging users to join Discord
- [ ] The message includes text like: "Join our Discord, introduce yourself, and get faster access"
- [ ] The Discord link (https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE) is clickable and opens in a new tab
- [ ] The Discord invitation is visually distinct and noticeable
- [ ] The link follows the same styling conventions as the existing GitHub link

## Location

The change applies to: `helix/frontend/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx`
