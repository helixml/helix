# Implementation Tasks

- [~] Update GitHub text in `frontend/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx` from "source code is available in our GitHub repo" to friendlier wording like "you can download it from our GitHub repo"
- [ ] Add a primary MUI Button component for the Discord CTA with text "Join our Discord"
- [ ] Style the button with the existing accent color (#00e891) and appropriate hover state
- [ ] Link the button to https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE (opens in new tab)
- [ ] Add supporting text above or below the button: "Introduce yourself and get faster access"
- [ ] Verify the page renders correctly with the updated text and button
