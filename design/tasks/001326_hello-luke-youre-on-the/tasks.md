# Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Update GitHub text in `frontend/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx` from "source code is available in our GitHub repo" to friendlier wording like "you can download it from our GitHub repo"
- [ ] Add Discord invitation text after the existing waitlist explanation text
- [ ] Include clickable Discord link (https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE) with appropriate styling
- [ ] Verify the page renders correctly with the updated text
