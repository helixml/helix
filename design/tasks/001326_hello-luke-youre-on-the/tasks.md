# Implementation Tasks

- [x] Update GitHub text in `frontend/src/pages/Waitlist.tsx` from "source code is available in our GitHub repo" to friendlier wording like "you can download it from our GitHub repo"
- [x] Add a primary MUI Button component for the Discord CTA with text "Join our Discord"
- [x] Style the button with the existing accent color (#00e891) and appropriate hover state
- [x] Link the button to https://discord.gg/VJftd844GE (opens in new tab)
- [x] Add supporting text above or below the button: "Introduce yourself and get faster access"
- [x] Verify the page renders correctly with the updated text and button
