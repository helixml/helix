# Requirements: Test Task for Docker Build Cache

## Overview

This is a test task created for Docker build cache testing purposes. It should be ignored and has no real implementation requirements.

## User Stories

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task exists and can be processed by the system
- [ ] No actual implementation is required
- [ ] Task can be safely ignored after testing
