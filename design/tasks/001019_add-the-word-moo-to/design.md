# Design: Add "moo" to hehe.txt

## Overview

Add the word "moo" to the file `hehe.txt`.

## Approach

Since `hehe.txt` does not currently exist in the repository, the implementation will create the file and add the word "moo" to it.

## Key Decisions

1. **File location**: Create `hehe.txt` in the repository root (or specify location if provided later)
2. **Content**: The file will contain the word "moo"

## Implementation

Direct file creation/edit - no additional tooling or scripts required.
