Why Ubuntu 22.04 for Helix Desktop Containers

1. GNOME 42 Stability with Xwayland (Primary Reason)

Your architecture runs GNOME inside Xwayland (on Gamescope/Wolf). GNOME 44+ introduced significant X11/Xwayland regressions:

- GNOME 44/45: Window decoration rendering was moved to a separate process ("frames client"), causing timing issues that break window state management on both X11 and
Xwayland. https://discourse.gnome.org/t/gnome-and-mutter-45-and-44-is-a-downgrade-to-gnome-43/18346
- GNOME 45: Serious X11 session restart crash (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mutter/+bug/2040453)
- GNOME 46/47: Continued NVIDIA + X11 performance issues - micro-stutter when dragging windows, resize lag
- GNOME 48: Edge-tiling preview animations cause MIT-SHM crashes under Xwayland (discovered during your testing)

GNOME 42 (Ubuntu 22.04) has none of these issues. It's been stable with Wolf/Gamescope for over 2 years.

2. Proven in Production with Wolf/Games on Whales

From your design docs:
"Zorin container (Ubuntu 22.04/GNOME 42-43 fork) works correctly... Real-world proof that older GNOME + Xwayland is stable under Wolf/Gamescope"

The https://games-on-whales.github.io/wolf/stable/user/quickstart.html shows testing with CUDA containers based on Ubuntu 22.04 images. This is the battle-tested
combination.

3. glibc Compatibility (Binary Portability)

You build Zed and other tools that need to run in containers. Ubuntu 22.04 uses glibc 2.35. A binary built on 22.04 works on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 (native)
- Ubuntu 24.04 (forward-compatible)
- Ubuntu 25.04 (forward-compatible)

A binary built on 24.04+ cannot run on 22.04 due to glibc being forward-compatible only.

4. Enterprise LTS Support

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS: Support until 2027 (standard), 2032 (Pro)
- Battle-tested since April 2022 - "many proprietary ML platforms still target 22.04 as their primary supported platform"
(https://python.plainenglish.io/ubuntu-22-04-vs-24-04-the-brutal-truth-every-ai-ml-engineer-needs-to-know-f0f55dad4931)

5. 33% Smaller Image Size

From your design docs:
| Base                    | Size    |
|-------------------------|---------|
| Zorin GOW (24.04-based) | 8.11 GB |
| Pure Ubuntu 22.04       | 5.41 GB |

Summary for Your Colleague

"We use Ubuntu 22.04 because GNOME 44+ introduced X11/Xwayland regressions that cause crashes and performance issues in our Wolf/Gamescope streaming architecture. GNOME 42
on 22.04 is proven stable in this environment. We'll upgrade once GNOME's Xwayland support matures - likely end of 2025 when the ecosystem has stabilized around 24.04."
