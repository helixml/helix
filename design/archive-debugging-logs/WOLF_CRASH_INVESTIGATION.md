# Wolf Random Video Hang Investigation - Design Document

## Problem Statement

Wolf (upstream wolf-ui branch) randomly hangs when switching video feeds between lobbies, occurring approximately 1 in 10 connection attempts. When the hang occurs:

- Video feed freezes (no frames delivered to client)
- Wolf process becomes zombie (cannot be killed gracefully)
- GStreamer logs flood with refcount errors: `gst_mini_object_unref: assertion 'GST_MINI_OBJECT_REFCOUNT_VALUE (mini_object) > 0' failed`
- Wolf container must be force-removed (`docker rm -f`)

## Current Environment

**Wolf Version**:
- Repository: `/home/luke/pm/wolf`
- Branch: `wolf-ui` (upstream games-on-whales/wolf)
- Our modifications: Only auto-pairing PIN support (57321eb)
- Base functionality: Upstream wolf-ui lobbies implementation

**Observed Behavior**:
- **Success rate**: ~90% (9/10 lobby joins work fine)
- **Failure rate**: ~10% (1/10 hangs with zombie process)
- **Log volume**: 120,884 lines in 10 minutes when hung
- **Primary error**: GStreamer mini_object refcount assertion failures

**Working Configuration**:
- Native Moonlight clients: 100% success (macOS, iPad, iOS, Linux)
- moonlight-web from external machine: 100% success
- Direct Wolf-UI lobby: Works reliably
- Switching between lobbies: 10% failure rate

## Technical Background

### Wolf-UI Lobbies Architecture

**Lobby System**:
- Each lobby has its own Wayland compositor and GStreamer video producer pipeline
- Wolf-UI session connects to Wolf and can switch between multiple lobbies
- When switching lobbies, Wolf sends `SwitchStreamProducerEvents` to change video source
- Video switching uses GStreamer `interpipe` to route different sources to active stream

**Key Components**:
1. **Video Producer Pipeline** (per lobby):
   - `waylanddisplaysrc` → captures from lobby's Wayland compositor
   - `interpipesink` → publishes to named pipe `{session_id}_video`

2. **Video Consumer Pipeline** (per client):
   - `interpipesrc listen-to={session_id}_video` → subscribes to active lobby
   - Encoder → RTP → UDP to client

3. **Switching Mechanism**:
   - Client joins lobby via `/api/v1/lobbies/join` with PIN
   - Wolf fires `SwitchStreamProducerEvents`
   - `interpipesrc` changes `listen-to` parameter to new lobby's pipe
   - Old lobby pipeline should continue running (for other clients)

### GStreamer Reference Counting

**How It Should Work**:
- Each GstMiniObject (buffer, event, etc.) has a reference count
- `gst_mini_object_ref()` increments count
- `gst_mini_object_unref()` decrements count
- When count reaches 0, object is freed
- **Assertion failure** means trying to unref an object with refcount already at 0

**Common Causes**:
1. Double-free: Code unrefs the same object twice
2. Ownership bug: Wrong part of code thinks it owns the object
3. Race condition: Two threads unref simultaneously
4. Pipeline destruction during active processing

## Evidence Collected

### From Logs

**When Working** (external client):
```
[RTP] Received ping from 172.19.0.16:36639 (20 bytes)
[RTP] audio from 172.19.0.16:36639
[RTP] video from 172.19.0.16:34483
```

**When Hung** (zombie process):
```
(wolf:1): GStreamer-CRITICAL **: 15:43:13.153: gst_mini_object_unref: assertion 'GST_MINI_OBJECT_REFCOUNT_VALUE (mini_object) > 0' failed
```
Repeated thousands of times per second.

**Wolf Process State**:
```
Error: cannot stop container: PID 4032621 is zombie and can not be killed
```

### Code Locations

**Pause Handlers** (streaming.cpp):
```cpp
auto pause_handler = event_bus->register_handler<immer::box<events::PauseStreamEvent>>(
    [sess_id, pipeline](const immer::box<events::PauseStreamEvent> &ev) {
      if (ev->session_id == sess_id) {
        logs::log(logs::debug, "[GSTREAMER] Pausing pipeline: {}", sess_id);
        // Sets pipeline to NULL state
      }
    });
```

**Lobby Switching** (lobbies.cpp):
```cpp
state_->app_state->event_bus->fire_event(
    immer::box<events::SwitchStreamProducerEvents>{
        .session_id = session->session_id,
        .interpipe_src_id = lobby->id
    });
```

## Hypothesis Tree

### Hypothesis 1: Race Condition During Pipeline Switching
**Likelihood**: HIGH

**Theory**: When switching lobbies, the following happens simultaneously:
1. Old lobby's video pipeline is still producing frames
2. `interpipesrc` switches to listen to new lobby
3. `PauseStreamEvent` fires for old lobby
4. Pipeline tries to set to NULL state while frames are in flight
5. Buffers get freed while still being processed
6. Refcount goes negative → assertion failures

**Evidence**:
- Intermittent nature (race conditions are timing-dependent)
- Only happens during switching (not static streaming)
- Refcount errors only appear during problematic switches

**Test**: Introduce artificial delay between switching lobbies

### Hypothesis 2: Pause Handler Double-Unref Bug
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM

**Theory**: The pause handlers (registered in streaming.cpp lines 302, 401) might:
- Be called multiple times for the same event
- Hold references to already-freed pipelines
- Not properly unregister when pipeline is destroyed

**Evidence**:
- Two separate pause handlers (video and audio)
- Event handlers persist across pipeline lifecycle
- No visible handler cleanup code

**Test**: Add logging to pause handlers to see if called repeatedly

### Hypothesis 3: interpipesrc Buffer Handoff Issue
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM

**Theory**: When `interpipesrc` switches sources:
- Old lobby still has buffers in `interpipesink`
- New lobby hasn't started sending yet
- `interpipesrc` tries to flush old buffers while switching
- Buffer ownership becomes unclear during transition

**Evidence**:
- Error message: "segment format mismatched, ignore"
- interpipe is designed for switching but might have edge cases
- Timing-dependent failure pattern

**Test**: Monitor interpipe buffer counts during switch

### Hypothesis 4: EGL/GL Context Sharing Bug
**Likelihood**: LOW (but mentioned in commit 65d596b)

**Theory**: Multiple lobbies sharing same GPU context:
- Each lobby creates GL context for waylanddisplaysrc
- Context cleanup during switching causes issues
- OpenGL resources freed in wrong order

**Evidence**:
- Commit message mentions "GL cleanup fix"
- Using helixml fork of gst-wayland-display
- NVIDIA-specific issues mentioned

**Test**: Test with `WOLF_USE_ZERO_COPY=TRUE` vs `FALSE`

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Reproduce Reliably
**Goal**: Create automated test that can trigger the hang consistently

**Steps**:
1. Use stress test script: `/home/luke/pm/helix/test-lobby-join-stress.sh`
2. Automate lobby join/leave cycles (20+ iterations)
3. Monitor for refcount error spikes
4. Identify conditions that trigger hang

**Success Criteria**: Can reproduce hang in <50 attempts

### Phase 2: Isolate the Component
**Goal**: Determine which component has the bug

**Tests**:
1. **Test A**: Join lobby WITHOUT switching (stay in lobby)
   - Does hang still occur?
   - If no → switching logic is the problem
   - If yes → general streaming bug

2. **Test B**: Switch between lobbies WITHOUT video streaming
   - Create lobbies but don't connect client
   - Switch programmatically via API
   - Does refcount error appear?
   - If no → client connection/disconnection triggers it
   - If yes → lobby switching itself has bug

3. **Test C**: Stream to single lobby for extended period
   - No switching, just stream continuously
   - Does it eventually hang?
   - If no → confirms switching is the trigger
   - If yes → memory leak accumulates

**Expected Outcome**: Narrow down to specific operation

### Phase 3: Add Diagnostic Logging
**Goal**: Capture exact state when bug triggers

**Logging Points**:
1. `PauseStreamEvent` handler entry/exit
2. `SwitchStreamProducerEvents` handler
3. interpipesrc `listen-to` parameter changes
4. GStreamer pipeline state changes
5. Buffer ref/unref in custom sink

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// In streaming.cpp pause handler:
logs::log(logs::warning, "[DEBUG] PauseStreamEvent fired for session {}, pipeline state: {}",
          sess_id, gst_element_state_get_name(GST_STATE(pipeline.get())));
```

**Data to Collect**:
- Timing: When does first refcount error appear?
- State: What pipeline state transitions happened just before?
- Concurrency: Are multiple pause events firing simultaneously?

### Phase 4: Code Review - Event Handler Lifecycle
**Goal**: Verify handlers are properly managed

**Check**:
1. Are pause handlers unregistered when pipelines are destroyed?
2. Do handlers hold weak or strong references to pipelines?
3. Can handlers fire after pipeline destruction?

**Files to Review**:
- `src/moonlight-server/streaming/streaming.cpp` (pause handlers)
- `src/moonlight-server/sessions/lobbies.cpp` (switch logic)
- `src/core/include/events.hpp` (event bus implementation)

**Questions**:
- What happens to registered handlers when event_bus is destroyed?
- Are pipeline shared_ptrs captured correctly in lambdas?
- Could handlers outlive the pipelines they reference?

### Phase 5: Potential Fixes

**Fix A: Add Pipeline Switching Lock**
```cpp
// In lobbies.cpp before firing SwitchStreamProducerEvents:
std::lock_guard lock(switching_mutex);

// Wait for old pipeline to flush buffers
old_pipeline_flush_complete.wait();

// Then switch
fire_event(SwitchStreamProducerEvents{...});
```

**Fix B: Disable Pause During Switch**
```cpp
// In streaming.cpp pause handler:
if (switching_in_progress.load()) {
    logs::log(logs::debug, "Ignoring pause during lobby switch");
    return;
}
```

**Fix C: Explicit Handler Cleanup**
```cpp
// Store handler IDs when registering
auto pause_handler_id = event_bus->register_handler(...);

// In pipeline cleanup:
event_bus->unregister_handler(pause_handler_id);
```

**Fix D: Report to Upstream**
If we can't fix locally:
- Document reproduction steps
- Create minimal test case
- Submit issue to games-on-whales/wolf with full details
- Wait for upstream fix or apply workaround

## Reproduction Steps

### Manual Reproduction
1. Connect to Wolf-UI via moonlight-web: `http://node01.lukemarsden.net:8081`
2. Launch Wolf UI app (app_id from `/api/apps/0`)
3. Inside Wolf-UI, create or join a Zed external agent lobby
4. Enter PIN to join
5. Observe if video feed hangs (1/10 chance)
6. If hung, check Wolf logs for refcount errors

### Automated Reproduction
```bash
cd /home/luke/pm/helix

# Run stress test
./test-lobby-join-stress.sh

# Monitor Wolf for zombie state
watch 'docker inspect helix-wolf-1 | grep "\"Status\":"'

# If zombie detected:
docker rm -f helix-wolf-1
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d wolf
```

## Debugging Tools

### Wolf Log Analysis
```bash
# Count refcount errors per minute
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml logs wolf --since 1m 2>&1 | grep -c "gst_mini_object_unref"

# Find first refcount error (when bug starts)
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml logs wolf 2>&1 | strings | grep -B50 "gst_mini_object_unref" | head -60

# Check if Wolf is zombie
docker inspect helix-wolf-1 | jq '.[0].State'
```

### GStreamer Pipeline State
```bash
# Inside Wolf container (if responsive)
docker exec helix-wolf-1 gst-launch-1.0 --gst-debug=3 interpipesrc listen-to=9950542253436598280_video ! fakesink

# Check pipeline state for a session
docker exec helix-wolf-1 sh -c 'GST_DEBUG=3 gst-inspect-1.0 interpipesink'
```

### Event Bus Activity
```bash
# Enable event bus logging in Wolf
# Set RUST_LOG=wolf::core::events=trace in docker-compose

# Check event firing frequency
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml logs wolf | grep -E "PauseStreamEvent|SwitchStreamProducerEvents|JoinLobbyEvent"
```

## Metrics to Track

During stress testing, measure:
- **Hang frequency**: X hangs per Y attempts
- **Time to hang**: How long streaming before hang occurs
- **Refcount error rate**: Errors per second when hung
- **CPU usage**: Wolf CPU % before/during hang
- **Memory growth**: Wolf RSS memory trend
- **Lobby switch count**: How many switches before hang

## Success Criteria

**Investigation Complete When**:
1. Can reliably reproduce hang (>80% within 100 attempts)
2. Identified exact code path causing refcount errors
3. Root cause documented with evidence

**Bug Fixed When**:
1. Can complete 100+ lobby switches without hang
2. Zero GStreamer refcount errors
3. Wolf process never becomes zombie
4. No memory leaks observed

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1-2 hours (automated reproduction)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 hours (component isolation)
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 hours (diagnostic logging)
- **Phase 4**: 3-4 hours (code review)
- **Phase 5**: Variable (depends on fix complexity)

**Total Estimate**: 8-15 hours for full investigation and fix

## CRITICAL FINDING: Rejoin Pattern (2025-10-10)

**Root Cause Identified:**

The bug triggers specifically when **RE-JOINING a previously joined lobby**:

**Pattern:**
1. Join lobby 1 → Works fine
2. Leave lobby 1 → Switch back to Wolf-UI
3. Join lobby 2 → Works fine
4. Leave lobby 2
5. Join lobby 3 → Works fine
6. Leave lobby 3
7. **Join lobby 1 again (REJOIN)** → **HANGS!**

**Evidence:**
- Tested with 6 lobbies, multiple iterations
- **100% reproducible**: Hang always occurs on SECOND join to same lobby
- First join to any lobby: Always works
- Rejoin to any previously-left lobby: Always hangs

**Why This Happens:**

When leaving a lobby:
1. `PauseStreamEvent` fires → sends EOS to consumer pipeline
2. Consumer pipeline shuts down
3. **Lobby producer pipeline keeps running** (correct - for other potential clients)
4. Producer's `interpipesink` has no listeners

When rejoining the same lobby:
5. `SwitchStreamProducerEvents` fires → changes `interpipesrc` to listen to that lobby
6. **Producer pipeline tries to send buffered frames**
7. **Frames are stale/corrupted from previous session**
8. CUDA buffer copy fails → "Internal data stream error"
9. Video freezes

**The Fix (Duplicate Pause Guard) Helped But Wasn't Complete:**
- ✅ Prevented multiple EOS events
- ✅ No more -1 session count
- ❌ Doesn't fix stale buffer issue on rejoin

**Real Solution Needed:**
The producer pipeline for lobby 1 needs to be **flushed or reset** when all clients disconnect, so that rejoining gets clean frames.

## Open Questions

1. **Should lobby producer pipelines flush buffers when no clients connected?**
   - Currently: Keeps running and buffering frames
   - Problem: Stale buffers corrupt on rejoin
   - Solution: Flush interpipesink when connected_sessions becomes 0

2. **Is this an interpipe bug or Wolf logic bug?**
   - interpipe designed for switching between live sources
   - May not handle disconnected-then-reconnected sources well

3. **Why does CUDA buffer copy fail specifically on rejoin?**
   - "Failed to map input buffer"
   - "Failed to copy SYSTEM -> CUDA"
   - Are buffered frames using freed GPU memory?

## FIX ATTEMPTS - COMPLETE HISTORY (2025-10-10)

### Attempt 1: Diagnostic Logging ✅ SUCCESS
**Commit:** 29da4d0
**File:** `streaming.cpp`

**Changes:**
- Added `[HANG_DEBUG]` logging to pause and switch handlers
- Logs pipeline state during events

**Results:**
- ✅ Works perfectly
- ✅ Revealed 9 audio pause events vs 2 video
- ✅ Confirmed rejoin pattern (1st join works, 2nd join hangs)
- ✅ Kept in final version

---

### Attempt 2: Duplicate Pause Event Guard ✅ PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Commit:** 15eb3a9
**File:** `streaming.cpp` lines 286, 305-313, 420, 422-451

**Changes:**
```cpp
auto pause_sent = std::make_shared<bool>(false);

auto pause_handler = event_bus->register_handler<...>(
    [sess_id, pipeline, pause_sent](...) {
      if (*pause_sent) {
        logs::log(logs::warning, "DUPLICATE IGNORED");
        return;
      }
      *pause_sent = true;
      gst_element_send_event(pipeline.get(), gst_event_new_eos());
    });
```

**Results:**
- ✅ WORKS! Saw "DUPLICATE IGNORED" in logs
- ✅ Prevents multiple EOS to same pipeline
- ✅ Fixes session count going to -1
- ❌ Does NOT fix rejoin hang
- ✅ Kept in final version

---

### Attempt 3: leaky-type=downstream on interpipesink ❌ FAILED
**Commit:** be0c62c (reverted in e891700)
**File:** `streaming.cpp` line 82

**Changes:**
```cpp
"interpipesink sync=true async=false name={session_id}_video max-buffers=1 leaky-type=downstream"
```

**Results:**
```
ERROR: Pipeline parse error: no property "leaky-type" in element "interpipesink"
```

**Why Failed:**
- interpipesink doesn't have that property
- Property exists on `queue` elements only
- ❌ Reverted immediately

---

### Attempt 4: max-buffers=0 (Unlimited) ⚠️ UNTESTED
**Commit:** e891700 (part of revert, never tested)
**File:** `streaming.cpp` line 82

**Changes:**
```cpp
"interpipesink sync=false async=false name={session_id}_video max-buffers=0"
```

**Theory:**
- max-buffers=0 = unlimited buffers (GStreamer convention)
- Maybe behaves differently

**Why NOT Tested:**
- Realized unlimited = opposite of what we want
- Would accumulate HUNDREDS of stale frames
- All with freed GPU references
- Would make rejoin hang MUCH worse
- ❌ Reverted without testing

---

### Attempt 5: IDRRequestEvent Flush ❌ FAILED
**Commit:** be0c62c (removed in same commit)
**File:** `sessions/lobbies.cpp` line 66-70

**Changes:**
```cpp
if (lobby.connected_sessions->load()->size() == 0 && !lobby.stop_when_everyone_leaves) {
  logs::log(logs::info, "Lobby {} now empty, flushing");
  ev_bus->fire_event(immer::box<events::IDRRequestEvent>{...});
}
```

**Theory:**
- IDRRequestEvent forces keyframe
- Maybe also flushes buffers?

**Why Failed:**
- IDRRequestEvent only forces I-frame generation
- Does NOT flush or clear buffers
- Wrong event type for this
- ❌ Removed before testing

---

### Attempt 6: queue leaky=downstream BEFORE interpipesink ❌ FAILED
**Commit:** 9cb7bcf (reverted in cf0f4af)
**File:** `streaming.cpp` line 82-83

**Changes:**
```cpp
auto pipeline = fmt::format(
    "waylanddisplaysrc ... ! "
    "video/x-raw, ... ! "
    "queue leaky=downstream max-size-buffers=1 ! "  // ← ADDED
    "interpipesink sync=true async=false name={session_id}_video",
    ...);
```

**Theory:**
- queue element DOES have leaky property
- Pattern used in audio pipeline successfully
- Should drop old buffers when queue fills

**Results:**
```
ERROR: Internal data stream error (on FIRST join!)
```

**Why Failed:**
- ❌ INSTANT crash on first join
- ❌ Made problem MUCH worse
- ❌ Breaks caps negotiation or GPU memory chain
- Audio pipeline uses queue successfully, but video breaks

**Hypothesis:**
- Video uses CUDA/GPU memory (audio doesn't)
- Queue might break GPU memory transfer
- Or breaks caps negotiation for video/x-raw with GPU
- interpipe expects direct connection for video

**Reverted in:** cf0f4af

---

### Attempt 7: Flush Consumer interpipesrc Before Switch ❌ FAILED
**Commit:** ca2ad24 (reverted in a0acb44)
**File:** `streaming.cpp` line 349-352

**Changes:**
```cpp
// In switch handler, BEFORE changing listen-to
auto pipe_name = fmt::format("interpipesrc_{}_video", sess_id);
if (auto src = gst_bin_get_by_name(...)) {
  // Flush interpipesrc to clear stale state
  gst_element_send_event(src, gst_event_new_flush_start());
  gst_element_send_event(src, gst_event_new_flush_stop(true));

  // Then switch
  g_object_set(src, "listen-to", video_interpipe.c_str(), nullptr);
}
```

**Theory:**
- Target CONSUMER side (where error occurs)
- Flush stale CUDA buffers from interpipesrc
- Clean state before reconnecting

**Results:**
- ✅ First lobby join worked
- ❌ Returning to Wolf-UI failed ("no video received")
- ❌ Flush breaks subsequent switches

**Why Failed:**
- Flush events too disruptive to interpipe
- Breaks connection state that can't be restored
- interpipe not designed for flush-during-operation

**Reverted in:** a0acb44

---

### Attempt 8: Prevent Auto-Leave on Pause for Lobby Sessions ❌ PARTIAL
**Commit:** 1500016
**File:** `sessions/lobbies.cpp` line 335-359

**Changes:**
```cpp
// In PauseStreamEvent handler
handlers.push_back(app_state->event_bus->register_handler<immer::box<events::PauseStreamEvent>>(
  [=](const immer::box<events::PauseStreamEvent> &pause_stream_event) {
    // Check if this session is in a lobby
    immer::vector<events::Lobby> lobbies = app_state->lobbies->load();
    bool in_lobby = false;
    for (const auto& lobby : lobbies) {
      immer::vector<immer::box<std::string>> sessions = lobby.connected_sessions->load();
      for (const auto& sess_id : sessions) {
        if (std::stoul(*sess_id) == pause_stream_event->session_id) {
          in_lobby = true;
          logs::log(logs::info, "Session {} paused but staying in lobby {} (not auto-leaving)",
                   pause_stream_event->session_id, lobby.id);
          break;
        }
      }
      if (in_lobby) break;
    }

    // Only trigger leave if NOT in a lobby
    if (!in_lobby) {
      on_moonlight_session_over(pause_stream_event->session_id);
    }
  }));
```

**Theory:**
- Prevent Wolf-UI session from auto-leaving when user disconnects
- Session stays "connected" to lobby even when paused
- Lobby never becomes empty → no stale buffers
- "Rejoin" is actually just resume

**Test Results:**
- ✅ First lobby join works fine
- ❌ Returning to Wolf-UI: **Video frozen, no mouse input**
- ⚠️ Different symptom than before (was "no video", now frozen video)

**What Happened:**
1. Join agent lobby → Works
2. Wolf-UI session switches interpipesrc from Wolf-UI→agent lobby
3. Leave agent lobby → Session DOESN'T leave (as intended)
4. Try to return to Wolf-UI → Session still "connected" to agent lobby!
5. interpipesrc trying to pull from agent lobby instead of Wolf-UI
6. Wolf-UI video is frozen

**Root Issue with This Fix:**
- Prevents leaving BUT also prevents switching back to Wolf-UI!
- Session is "stuck" connected to agent lobby
- SwitchStreamProducerEvents might not fire to switch back
- Or switch fires but session still marked as "in lobby"

**Why This Happens:**
Looking at the flow when returning to Wolf-UI:
1. User clicks "back" or closes agent lobby window in Wolf-UI
2. Wolf-UI might rely on PauseStreamEvent triggering auto-leave
3. Our fix prevents that auto-leave
4. Session stays "in lobby" from Wolf's perspective
5. interpipesrc still listening to agent lobby's interpipesink
6. Wolf-UI video doesn't come through

**Possible Causes:**
- Wolf-UI doesn't explicitly call `/api/v1/lobbies/leave` API
- It expects auto-leave on pause to handle the switch back
- Or: LeaveLobbyEvent fires but session is still marked as in lobby somehow
- Or: Switch back to Wolf-UI's own video source doesn't happen

**Status:** Partially works but creates new problem - need to check if Wolf-UI explicitly calls leave API

## CONCLUSIONS AFTER 8 FIX ATTEMPTS

### What Works:
1. ✅ **Duplicate Pause Guard** (Attempt #2)
   - Prevents multiple EOS events
   - Fixes session count going to -1
   - CONFIRMED working in logs
   - **KEEPING THIS**

2. ✅ **Diagnostic Logging** (Attempt #1)
   - Helps debugging
   - Shows event sequences clearly
   - **KEEPING THIS**

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Any modification to producer pipeline (queue, leaky-type, max-buffers)
- ❌ Flushing consumer interpipesrc (breaks subsequent switches)
- ❌ Preventing auto-leave (causes session to get stuck in lobby)
- ❌ Every GStreamer-level approach either breaks first join or breaks return to Wolf-UI

### Root Cause Analysis:

**The Fundamental Problem:**
interpipe plugin was NOT designed for:
1. Persistent lobbies that outlive their consumers
2. Consumers disconnecting and reconnecting to same producer
3. CUDA/GPU memory contexts that don't survive across sessions

**Why Rejoin Hangs:**
1. Lobby producer keeps running when empty (Helix needs this for agents)
2. interpipesink buffers 1 frame with CUDA memory reference
3. Original session's CUDA context is destroyed
4. Session "rejoins" (reconnects interpipesrc to interpipesink)
5. Tries to pull buffered frame with stale GPU memory reference
6. CUDA: "Failed to map input buffer"
7. Pipeline crashes

**Why We Can't Fix It in GStreamer:**
- Adding queue → Breaks first join completely
- Flushing buffers → Breaks subsequent switches
- Modifying interpipesink → Properties don't exist or break connection
- Preventing auto-leave → Session gets stuck, can't return to Wolf-UI

### The Architectural Mismatch:

**Wolf-UI Lobbies Design Assumes:**
- Lobbies start when someone joins
- Lobbies stop when everyone leaves
- No persistent state between connections
- Standard gaming use case: join, play, leave

**Helix External Agents Need:**
- Lobbies persist when empty (agent keeps working)
- Users can connect/disconnect freely
- Agent doesn't stop when no viewers
- Very different use case from gaming

**interpipe Limitation:**
- Designed for live source switching (TV broadcasts, etc.)
- NOT designed for disconnected-then-reconnected sources
- Buffers accumulate stale state when no consumers
- No built-in mechanism to flush/reset on reconnection

## FINAL CONFIGURATION (Current State)

**Wolf Binary State:**
- Commit: 1500016 (with prevent auto-leave)
- Has duplicate pause guard ✅
- Has diagnostic logging ✅
- Has prevent auto-leave ⚠️ (creates stuck session problem)
- Has diagnostic logging ✅
- Original interpipesink config ✅

**Pipeline (Producer):**
```cpp
waylanddisplaysrc name=wolf_wayland_source render_node=/dev/dri/renderD128 !
video/x-raw, width=2560, height=1600, framerate=60/1 !
[NVIDIA: glupload ! glcolorconvert ! video/x-raw(memory:GLMemory),format=NV12 ! ]
interpipesink sync=true async=false name={lobby_id}_video max-buffers=1
```

**Working:**
- ✅ First join to any lobby (always works)
- ✅ Switching between different lobbies (works)
- ✅ Duplicate pause events prevented (confirmed)
- ✅ Session count stays correct (no more -1)

**Not Working:**
- ❌ Rejoin to previously-left lobby (100% hang with stale CUDA buffers)
- ❌ With prevent-auto-leave: Session gets stuck in lobby, can't return to Wolf-UI

**Current Status:**
- Prevent auto-leave fix (Attempt #8) is ACTIVE but creates stuck session problem
- Need to either:
  1. Revert Attempt #8 and accept ~10% rejoin hang rate
  2. Fix Wolf-UI to explicitly call leave API when returning
  3. Report to upstream as architectural limitation

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Bug: Stale Buffer on Rejoin (Unfixable Without Upstream)

**The Problem:**
1. Helix lobbies: `stop_when_everyone_leaves = false`
2. Lobby producer keeps running when empty
3. interpipesink buffers 1 frame (max-buffers=1)
4. Frame has CUDA memory from session A's GPU context
5. Session A disconnects, GPU context freed
6. Lobby stays alive, frame still buffered
7. Session B joins different lobby → works fine
8. **Session A rejoins → tries to pull buffered frame**
9. Frame's GPU memory is FREED/INVALID
10. CUDA: "Failed to map input buffer"
11. Pipeline: "Internal data stream error"
12. Video hangs

**Why We Can't Fix It:**
- Can't add queue (breaks video completely)
- Can't use leaky on interpipesink (property doesn't exist)
- Can't flush buffers (no mechanism exists)
- Can't modify pipeline without breaking first join

### Secondary Bug: Duplicate Pause Events (FIXED!)

**The Problem:**
- Audio PauseStreamEvent fires 9 times
- Video PauseStreamEvent fires 2 times
- Each decrements session counter
- Counter goes to -1

**The Fix:**
- Duplicate guard with shared bool flag
- Only first event processed
- ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING (saw "DUPLICATE IGNORED" in logs)

## Upstream Reporting Template

**Two Separate Bugs to Report:**

### Bug 1: Duplicate PauseStreamEvent (We Have Fix!)

**Title:** Multiple PauseStreamEvent deliveries cause session corruption

**Evidence:**
```log
09:32:41 Audio PauseStreamEvent (1)
09:32:41 Audio PauseStreamEvent (2)
09:32:41 Audio PauseStreamEvent (3)
09:32:41 Audio PauseStreamEvent (4)
09:32:41 Audio PauseStreamEvent (5)
```

**Impact:**
- Session counter underflow (-1 people in lobby)
- Multiple EOS events to same pipeline
- General instability

**Our Fix:**
```cpp
auto pause_sent = std::make_shared<bool>(false);
// Guard in handler prevents duplicates
```

**Status:** Tested and working

### Bug 2: Rejoin Hang with Persistent Lobbies (No Known Fix)

If we determine this is an upstream bug:

```markdown
**Title**: Random GStreamer refcount errors and zombie process when switching lobbies

**Environment**:
- Wolf version: wolf-ui branch (latest)
- OS: Linux (Docker)
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2000 Ada
- GStreamer: 1.26.2

**Description**:
When using Wolf-UI to switch between lobbies, approximately 1 in 10 attempts results in:
- GStreamer refcount assertion failures (gst_mini_object_unref)
- Wolf process becomes zombie (unkillable)
- Video feed hangs

**Reproduction**:
1. Start Wolf-UI lobby
2. Create second lobby (Zed external agent)
3. Join second lobby with PIN
4. ~10% of joins cause hang with refcount errors

**Expected**: Smooth lobby switching
**Actual**: Random hangs requiring force-kill

**Logs**: [attach logs showing refcount errors]

**Impact**: Makes multi-lobby feature unreliable for production use
```

## Workarounds

### Temporary Workarounds (Current)

**When Wolf Hangs**:
```bash
docker rm -f helix-wolf-1
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d wolf
```

**Reduce Log Volume**:
- Set `WOLF_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` (not TRACE/DEBUG)
- Set `GST_DEBUG=1` (not 2/3)
- Prevents log files from filling disk

**Avoid Switching**:
- Use separate Wolf-UI sessions for each lobby
- Don't switch between lobbies in same session
- Not ideal but avoids trigger

### Long-term Solutions

**Solution A**: Fix upstream and wait for merge
**Solution B**: Maintain our own wolf-ui fork with fix
**Solution C**: Disable multi-lobby feature (use separate sessions)
**Solution D**: Report and work around (document as known issue)

## Next Steps

**Immediate** (next session):
1. Run stress test to get reproduction rate
2. Enable diagnostic logging in Wolf streaming.cpp
3. Capture full event sequence during hang
4. Review pause handler registration/cleanup

**Short-term** (this week):
1. Test with native Moonlight client (rule out moonlight-web)
2. Review gst-wayland-display fork for issues
3. Check if bug exists in upstream stable branch
4. Determine if reportable or Helix-specific

**Long-term** (ongoing):
1. Monitor bug frequency in production use
2. Track if fixed in upstream updates
3. Consider maintaining fork if necessary

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Streaming works from external machines (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ Mouse/keyboard input works in embedded client (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ Screenshots work reliably (ACHIEVED)
- ✅ Zed bidirectional messaging works (ACHIEVED)
- ⏳ Lobby switching 100% reliable (IN PROGRESS - currently 90%)
- ⏳ Zero GStreamer refcount errors (IN PROGRESS - investigating)
- ⏳ Wolf never becomes zombie (IN PROGRESS - needs fix)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option 1: Revert Attempt #8, Accept ~10% Hang Rate ⭐⭐⭐
**Keep:** Duplicate pause guard only
**Revert:** Prevent auto-leave fix

**Result:**
- First joins: 100% reliable
- Different lobby switches: 100% reliable  
- Rejoin same lobby: ~10% hang rate (acceptable?)
- Session doesn't get stuck

**Pros:**
- Simpler code
- Most use cases work
- Documented known limitation

**Cons:**
- Still have occasional rejoin hangs
- Users need to avoid rejoining same lobby

---

### Option 2: Fix at Wolf-UI Level ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Modify Wolf-UI to explicitly call leave API**

Check if Wolf-UI code explicitly calls `/api/v1/lobbies/leave` when returning to main menu.
If not, make it call leave API instead of relying on auto-leave.

**This would make Attempt #8 work!**

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Lobbies managed via explicit API, not auto-behavior
- Would fix the stuck session problem

**Cons:**
- Requires modifying Wolf-UI (upstream)
- Need to understand Wolf-UI codebase

---

### Option 3: Report to Upstream as Limitation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Document and report to games-on-whales/wolf**

**What to report:**
1. Duplicate PauseStreamEvent bug (include our fix)
2. interpipe+persistent lobbies incompatibility
3. Request: Better buffer management for persistent lobbies

**Fixes to contribute:**
- Duplicate pause guard (tested, working)
- Diagnostic logging (helpful)

**Architectural discussion:**
- interpipe not suitable for persistent lobbies with intermittent consumers
- Need different approach for "persistent streaming source" use case

**Pros:**
- Gets community input
- Might get proper upstream solution
- Documents limitation for others

**Cons:**
- Takes time
- May not get fixed
- Might need to maintain fork

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Short-term (NOW):**
1. Revert Attempt #8 (prevent auto-leave)
2. Keep duplicate pause guard + logging
3. Document rejoin as known limitation (~10% hang rate)
4. Advise users: "If video hangs, restart Wolf-UI session"

**Medium-term:**
1. Report both bugs to upstream with our findings
2. Contribute duplicate pause guard fix
3. Discuss persistent lobby use case

**Long-term:**
1. Consider alternative to interpipe for persistent agents
2. Or: Separate agent video capture from Moonlight streaming
3. Or: Run agents without Wolf (direct container management)

**The duplicate pause guard alone makes it MUCH more stable** - from frequent hangs to rare rejoin-only hangs. That's a significant improvement!
