# MOONLIGHT_WEB_MODE Switching - Complete Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Successfully Implemented

### 1. Full Mode Switching Infrastructure (COMPLETE - Helix)

**Backend** (Commits: 00a234b8b, 10d581b9c, bf7fbc414):
- `wolf_executor_apps.go`: Mode-switching wrapper
  - `connectKeepaliveWebSocketForAppSingle()`: WebSocket to `/api/host/stream`
  - `connectKeepaliveWebSocketForAppMulti()`: REST POST to `/api/streamers`
- `agent_sandboxes_handlers.go`: Query correct endpoint based on mode
  - Single: `GET /api/sessions`
  - Multi: `GET /api/streamers`
- `types.go` + `handlers.go`: Expose `moonlight_web_mode` via `/api/v1/config`

**Frontend** (Commit: 8daaca705):
- Stream class restored with mode parameter (create/join/keepalive/peer)
- Mode-aware WebSocket endpoint selection
- Mode-aware AuthenticateAndInit (skip for peer mode)
- Mode-aware negotiation (join/peer wait for server offer)
- MoonlightStreamViewer fetches config and uses correct mode

**Moonlight-Web** (Commit: b3f73d3):
- Dockerfile optimizations (system OpenSSL, debug mode, cache improvements)
- Both branches have unique certificate generation

### 2. Verified Working

‚úÖ Config endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/config` returns `moonlight_web_mode: "single"`
‚úÖ Sessions API: `/api/sessions` returns 4 keepalive sessions
‚úÖ Backend switching: Correctly calls WebSocket vs REST API based on mode
‚úÖ Frontend switching: Fetches mode and creates Stream accordingly
‚úÖ WebRTC negotiation: Offer/Answer exchange working in both modes
‚úÖ ICE connection: Establishes successfully in single mode

## ‚ùå Single-Mode Issue Discovered

**Problem:** Video track binding breaks after ICE restart when browser joins keepalive session.

**Root Cause:**
1. Peer + tracks created BEFORE browser joins (in keepalive mode)
2. When browser joins, ICE restart on existing peer
3. Track bindings become paused/invalid after ICE restart
4. Video packets dropped (all_binding_paused() returns true)
5. Connection times out, black screen

**Evidence:**
- ICE connects at 05:40:35 ‚úÖ
- Peer connects at 05:40:36 ‚úÖ
- NO video write logs - packets being dropped
- Disconnects after 8 seconds due to no media flow
- Log: `[Keepalive]: Ignoring peer state Connected in keepalive mode`

## üöß Attempted Fix: Lazy WebRTC Peer Creation (WIP)

**Goal:** Don't create peer until browser joins, avoiding ICE restart issues entirely.

**Approach:**
1. In keepalive: NO peer, start Moonlight with dummy decoders (drop packets)
2. When browser joins: Create FRESH peer + tracks
3. Restart Moonlight with real decoders attached to fresh tracks
4. Clean peer setup, no ICE restart needed

**Status:** Partial implementation, does not compile (Commit: 6acfac5)
- ‚úÖ Struct updated with `Option<>` for peer/channel/input
- ‚úÖ Dummy decoders implemented
- ‚úÖ start_stream_headless() implemented
- ‚úÖ attach_tracks_to_stream() implemented
- ‚ùå Compilation errors (lifetime/ownership issues in callbacks)
- ‚ùå Needs 4-6 more hours of careful refactoring

## üéØ Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Multi-Mode (RECOMMENDED - Works Now)
```bash
export MOONLIGHT_WEB_MODE=multi

cd ~/pm/moonlight-web-stream
git checkout feat/multi-webrtc
cd ~/pm/helix
./stack build-moonlight-web

# Restart API to pick up env var
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml down api
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d api
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly right now
- ‚úÖ No video track issues
- ‚úÖ Supports multiple simultaneous viewers
- ‚úÖ Already tested and verified

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Broadcaster implementation was disabled due to performance issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs broadcaster fix for true multi-peer support

### Option 2: Complete Lazy Peer Refactor (4-6 hours)
Continue the refactor in moonlight-web-stream feature/session-persistence branch.

**Remaining Work:**
1. Fix lifetime issues in callback closures
2. Store API or rebuild it for lazy peer creation
3. Extensive testing of headless ‚Üí browser join flow
4. Handle edge cases (multiple browsers, disconnects, etc.)

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner architecture (no wasted peer creation)
- ‚úÖ Fixes root cause properly

**Cons:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è 4-6 hours of careful Rust async/lifetime work
- üêõ High risk of introducing new bugs
- üß™ Extensive testing needed

### Option 3: Simpler Single-Mode Fix (2 hours)
Instead of lazy peer creation, fix the ICE restart track binding issue:

When browser joins:
1. Don't use ICE restart
2. Instead: Close old peer, create completely fresh peer + tracks
3. Cleaner than ICE restart but still wastes initial peer

**Pros:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Much simpler than full refactor
- ‚úÖ Still fixes the root issue

**Cons:**
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Still creates unnecessary peer initially
- üîÑ Requires stopping/restarting Moonlight stream

## üìä Current State

**Helix (feature/external-agents-hyprland-working):**
- ‚úÖ Fully implements mode switching
- ‚úÖ Ready for both single and multi modes
- ‚úÖ All commits pushed

**Moonlight-Web (feature/session-persistence):**
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile optimized
- ‚úÖ `/api/sessions` endpoint working
- ‚ùå Video track binding issue
- üöß Lazy peer refactor WIP (does not compile)

**Moonlight-Web (feat/multi-webrtc):**
- ‚úÖ Fully working multi-peer architecture
- ‚úÖ Tested and verified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Broadcaster disabled (performance issue)

## üí° My Recommendation

**Use multi-mode** (Option 1). It's working right now, supports the use case, and gives you time to properly fix single-mode later if needed. The mode switching infrastructure is complete, so switching between modes is trivial.

The lazy peer refactor is the right architectural fix for single-mode, but it's a significant undertaking that needs careful attention to Rust ownership/lifetime rules.
