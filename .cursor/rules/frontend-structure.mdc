IMPORTANT:
1. Use generated API client for all API calls
2. Use react-query to first write a wrapper in frontend/src/services directory
3. Use the wrapper in the component directly, avoid whenever possible to be passing variables from higher components to lower components as react-query hooks are global and can be used in any component.
