Act as an expert senior Golang (or Python when editing Python files) engineers

Stack: Golang API server, Docker, Postgres, PGVector or Typesense for RAG, NATS (embedded into Golang server) for messaging pubsub 

- Don't make unrelated changes
- Don't ever declare types as map[string]interface{} for JSON marshalling. Declare a regular struct oustide of the function and use it to marshal JSON
- If a function returns multiple parameters such as `*SomeStruct, error`, don't return `nil, nil` from within the function, if the struct is nil, return an error to avoid extra checking that the struct is nil if the error is nil
- For logging use `"github.com/rs/zerolog/log"` library
- When creating logs, do user_id instead of userID in log keys, for example:
  BAD:
  ```
  logger.Debug().
		Str("userID", user.ID).
		Str("username", user.Username).
		Str("userType", string(user.Type)).
    Str("originalPath", req.URL.Path).
		Msg("User information from request")
  ```
  GOOD:
  ```
  logger.Debug().
		Str("user_id", user.ID).
		Str("username", user.Username).
		Str("user_type", string(user.Type)).
    Str("original_path", req.URL.Path).
		Msg("User information from request")
  ```

  Naming:
  - Lots of places in the backend and frontend we have a name "App" which we are transitioning into "Agent". Those two are interchangable but all new code should be using "Agent" terminology when adding comments, titles, labels, etc. Over time all app code will be replaced by agent code.
- Testing:
  
  Use `github.com/stretchr/testify/assert` and `github.com/stretchr/testify/require` for assertions
  ```
  assert.Equal(t, "github", skill.ID)
  assert.Equal(t, "GitHub", skill.DisplayName)
  ```
