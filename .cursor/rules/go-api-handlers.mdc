Act as a security conscious senior software developer. When implementing handlers think about whether handlers need authentication and authorization. 
- Do not reimplement logic that is in the authz.go
- When editing or adding new handlers, use existing functions such as `authorizeUserToApp` or `authorizeUserToResource`
- When editing or adding handlers, always include doc string such as
```
// createApp godoc
// @Summary Create new app
// @Description Create new app. Helix apps are configured with tools and knowledge.
// @Tags    apps

// @Success 200 {object} types.App
// @Param request    body types.App true "Request body with app configuration.")
// @Router /api/v1/apps [post]
// @Security BearerAuth
```
as this then generates the Swagger/OpenAPI definitions
